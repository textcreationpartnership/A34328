            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE crimſon bluſhes of <hi>Aurora</hi> had ſcarce gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the world an intimation of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Luminary's approach which was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten it, when there appear'd coming from a ſtately and magnificent Palace, ſo lovely a troop of Ladies, that had there yet wanted any thing of day, the Stars might in modeſty have retired from a new ſphear of brighter Conſtellations; among whom the Princeſs <hi>Diana</hi>'s beauty had luſtre enough to intimate the little want there was of a riſing Sun. She advanced at the head of this charming company, toward the verdant banks of the celebrated <hi>Po,</hi> where a cloſe walk of ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limes ſeem'd by overſhadowing the River where its motion was ſloweſt, to convert the Cryſtal ſtreams into a Looking-glaſs of Emrald. The agreeableneſs of the place ſo ſuitable to the Princeſſes melancholy, might have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56696:5"/>
detained her longer in it, had not the Barges waited to convey them to a little Iſland in the middle of the River, which compoſed a Garden wherein Art and Nature had equally contributed to captivate the Senſes. But the fair Princeſs giving too much way to a ſerious Reſervedneſs, participated leaſt of thoſe delights that curious Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of <hi>Flora</hi> was liberal in affording; making the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Endeavours of all the Ladies fruitleſs, in ſeeking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from her breaſt that oppreſſive Penſiveneſs ſhe was ready to ſink under. But that her contemplation might be the more undiſturbed; withdrawing to a ſhady Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to watered with many artificial Springs, and in the moſt retired part of the Garden; keeping no body with her but one young Lady, who was happy in having merited her privacy; ſhe commanded the reſt to purſue thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions her ſelf deſired to be a ſtranger to. They had ſcarce walked the length of the firſt Ally when they were met by ſeveral Lords and Gentlemen of the Court, who had followed in other Boats to the Iſland, attended by an excellent Conſort of Muſick, which they had brought to divert the Princeſs in her retirement. They were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at a convenient diſtance to make an eſſay of their skill, when they were interrupted by a confuſed noiſe from the farther ſide of the River, of people crying out, to ſeize, or kill the murderer. This unexpected diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance not only haſted the Ladies and Gentlemen toward that part from whence the noiſe came; but alſo drew the Princeſs from her ſolitude, to learn the occaſion of ſo much inſolence as they appeared guilty of who raiſed the diſorder. And coming to the end of a ſpatious walk which bounded on the Rivers ſide, they beheld with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, a young man endeavouring with his utmoſt ſtrength to force a ſwift Paſſage through the water, from thoſe who haſtily purſued his Swimming, in two little Barks; while a crowd of Peaſants aſſaulted him from the land with ſhowrs of ſtones. A Boat was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56696:5"/>
commanded from the Garden to his aſſiſtance; and the diligent Rowers ſo ſpeedily obeyed the Princeſſes command, that he was ſoon reſcued from the threatning danger, and brought to throw himſelf at <hi>Diana</hi>'s feet; who was no leſs ſurprized than the reſt of the company, when he was known to be <hi>Alexander,</hi> a noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and one that had not long before reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from her Court. <hi>Ceſareo</hi> a principal Officer of her Houſhold, and (long before) the unhappy fugitives friend, begging Leave that he might retire to put off his wet cloaths, beſought the Princeſs for his ſatisfaction, that ſome of the Country men might appear before her to diſcover the cauſe of their purſuit, and receive the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to the unworthy enemies of ſo conſiderable a perſon. While <hi>Alexander</hi> was gone to the Gardners with ſome of his friends to dry himſelf, a plain fellow was come over from the other ſide, who being brought before the Princeſs, and commanded to give an account of the Uproar, made this following relation:</p>
            <p>If it ſhall pleaſe your Grace, I am an honeſt husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and one of your Tenants in that Town upon the top of the Hill beyond the River, where in ſober truth we work hard, and take pains for an indifferent livelyhood, and to pay our rent in good time. Now, and it like you, that Town does not all belong to our Lady Dutcheſs; for behind that Grove of Trees on the ſide of the Hill there is as neat a Houſe as one would wiſh to ſet foot in, with the daintieſt contrivances of Walks, and Arbours, and Gardens, that I had a hand in the ordering ſome years ago: Now as to what I am to tell you concerning <hi>Alexander;</hi> well he's a parleſs naughty man, 'tis now about a month ago that he came with his new Wife, to take his pleaſure during the ſpring at that houſe, which, as I ſaid, ſtands beyond the Grove, and he belike borrowed it of Lord <hi>Ceſareo,</hi> who lives here at the Court, for it is <hi>Ceſareo</hi>'s own houſe, only he being much his friend was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56696:6"/>
willing to lend it him for a while; and in verity the Lady <hi>Cynthia</hi> his Wife, was one of the fineſt, handſomeſt, beſt natured young Gentlewomen that e're was bred in <hi>Italy.</hi> Oh ſhe was ſo courteous, as they ſay, to all us poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try folks, would ſo ſmile upon us, when we did any thing to make her merry, and would talk ſo kindly to our Wives and Daughters, as if ſhe had been one of us her ſelf. Now this good diſpoſition among other things made <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo dote upon her, that the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen; and who would think it, ſhe was ſo well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the recreations we made her, and with our way of living, that ſometimes ſhe has laid aſide her rich ſilks and jewels, to appear among us in ſuch plain ruſſet as we make our apparel on: Well if I had not almoſt forgot to tell you, there was another young Gentlewoman of her acquaintance that kept her company e'ne as good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſhe her ſelf; her name, as I remember, was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs <hi>Porcia:</hi> But to tell you all and make few words, <hi>Alexander</hi> ſeemed to love his Wife, as if ſhe had been ſtill to give her conſent, and has been heard to ſay he could take no pleaſure any where out of her ſight. But laſt night put a ſad end to all this joy; ay, laſt night, no longer ago, a little after it was dark, when all the people in the Village were going to Bed, we were called out into the ſtreet to hear the lamentableſt Cries that ever pierced any Chriſtians ears; this ſad noiſe coming as we gueſſed from <hi>Alexanders</hi> Grange, every body made haſte thither, to know what was the matter; and I my ſelf being pretty nimble, got thither one of the firſt, where all the doors were wide open, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants running about half ſcared out of their wits; whereupon asking one of them what ailed all that pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; he told me with blubbered eyes, that his Lady was dead, how that <hi>Alexander</hi> coming home when no body expected him, had killed his Wife and conveyed away her body that none of them could find it; I being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56696:6"/>
to learn the whole truth, followed the man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther room, where I ſaw, well it was a grievous ſpectacle, there lay Miſtreſs <hi>Porcia</hi> as dead as a Red-herring upon the floor, all over grimed with her own natural blood; and hard by her a fine young Gentleman called <hi>Alfredo,</hi> ſhot into the head, with no more life in him than the other; and it ſeems <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf had cruelly butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them all: in ſober earneſt it was one of the pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt nights that my eyes were ever open in: and to think that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould do ſuch a deed, to kill thoſe he ſeemed the very day before to love ſo well. Preſently ſome made haſte to the City to acquaint the kindred of the poor dead creatures with the ill news. While I, as your Highneſs Bayliff this year of the Village, and as in duty bound by my place, raiſed the Towns folks, who were all got by that time to <hi>Alexanders</hi> Grange, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding them into ſeveral companies, ſent out to ſearch for the man had done ſo much wickedneſs; but the night was ſpent to no purpoſe, and every body was about to go home again, when a workman going out at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break about his buſineſs, had ſpied a gentleman-like-man going into a little Cottage hard by the River; who tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me of it, I began to ſuſpect ſomewhat of the truth, hearing of a Gentleman up at that hour; ſo away I haſted with my men to the place, and making no noiſe, beſet the houſe. Alexander ſeeing himſelf betrayed, for it was he, and no hopes left of eſcaping (well it was a deſperate thing) leapt out of a window, and without receiving any hurt, got clear away from us all, and ran as hard as he could drive towards the River; truly I think it was his beſt way to truſt to his heels, for his hands would have done little good againſt all us: we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him ſtill ſo cloſe that, would you think it, he threw himſelf into the River, and ſo eſcaped by your help.</p>
            <p>There appeared too much horror in the Country mans ſtory, not to produce a tender ſenſe of grief in the breaſts
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56696:7"/>
of all that heard it; every one beſtowing a ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture on what might induce the barbarous <hi>Alexander</hi> to commit ſo ſtrange a piece of cruelty; that which might (to thoſe of his country) ſeem the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble incitement, was jealouſie, yet they found no cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumſtance to perſwade them his Anger proceede from that fatal Paſſion.

               </head>
               <p>I Do believe, dear <hi>Niſe,</hi> (ſaid the melancholick Princeſs) 'tis not only thy admiration, but that of all people; To ſee me yield to a Grief muſt appear very unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſince the occaſion of it is altogether unknown, even to thoſe who think themſelves beſt acquainted with all paſſages of my life; eſpecially at a time when in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, fortune has nothing to add whereby my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be more happy. But the aſſurance of thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and fidelity, removes thoſe ſcruples I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend againſt the revealing what I muſt needs allow a weakneſs; and incourages me with the leſs reluctance to make thee acquainted with the affliction I ſtruggle with, occaſion'd by an unfortunate paſſion. The very mention of that word oblig'd the Dutcheſs to turn her head aſide to conceal the Bluſhes, and dry thoſe Tears that Remembrance and the Confeſſion of it had forced from her; but quickly recollecting her ſelf, ſhe gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her beloved <hi>Niſe</hi> with a ſhort Narration of the moſt remarkable paſſages of her life. Although my Fathers Indulgence (proceeded the incomparable Lady) was much inferiour to his Severity, I am confident the whole world will grant my Sorrow for the loſs of him, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exceeded by thoſe who bewailed the death of a moſt tender Parent. Yet two compleat years being expired
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56696:8"/>
ſince Heaven was pleaſed I ſhould be deprived of him, the whole Province may have reaſon to believe 'tis ſome other cauſe prevents my receiving a full Satisfaction in the ſtate Heaven has been pleaſed to allow me, ſo much above others. And I muſt confeſs, did Ambition or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt rule my mind, it were unreaſonable to wiſh for more than I am already Miſtreſs of. My Father left me not only to the poſſeſſion of this flouriſhing Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but as great a Treaſure to maintain my Royalty as any Prince in <hi>Italy</hi> can boaſt him ſelf Maſter of. Were the enjoyment of liberty delightful to me, ſo generally ſought after, and wiſhed by thoſe of our ſex, above all other Bleſſings, how happy might I eſteem my ſelf in the difference there is between a recluſe life, ſuch as an awful Father confined me to, and that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd diſpoſal of my ſelf I now enjoy. But alas! how little is the benefit I reap from theſe advantages, while I lament the loſs of what was juſtly much dearer to me than all the Glories of eſtabliſht Sovereignty. I ſuppoſe you are not ignorant of that diſaſter made ſuch a noiſe in the Court about half a year before the death of my Father; and much about the time yours placed you here with me; I mean the murder of that moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht young Lord, <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Bolonna;</hi> who was moſt barbarouſly aſſaſſinated and thrown into the River as he returned one Evening late from the Palace to his Houſe.</p>
               <p>That unhappy Gentlemans deſtiny (ſaid the agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Niſe,</hi> finding the Princeſs with no ſmall diſturbance pauſe of the mention of ſo bloody a deed) filled all the Court, not only with Pity but Aſtoniſhment, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon admired and beloved by all who knew him, ſhould fall under ſo cruel a fate, in a place where his obliging carriage and unequal vertues had procured him many friends, but thought to have no enemy.</p>
               <p>Moſt certain, (continued the afflicted Lady, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her ſelf a little) none more deſerved an univerſal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56696:8"/>
admiration, or lived freer from being hated by the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; but alas, had his Merits been leſs, his Life had never been ſacrificed to the cruel reſentment of an unjuſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Prince. 'Tis now, Dear <hi>Niſe,</hi> I muſt diſcover to you a Secret the whole world is to this moment ignorant of. This unfortunate man, (by birth inferiour to none, as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from a Branch of that Family was once adorn'd with the Crown of <hi>Naples,</hi> and now enjoys the Throne of <hi>Sicily</hi>) Poſſeſſor of no inconſiderable Eſtate and Title, and one whoſe worth tranſcended all the advantages could be deduced from either; finding he was the free maſter of himſelf and fortune, reſolved for ſome years by travel from his native Countrey, to improve thoſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he thought he had only learnt the Theory of from his careful Tutors. After ſome months ſpent in ſeeing the moſt celebrated parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> he came into <hi>Italy,</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting, (after a ſhort abode at <hi>Rome,</hi>) the principal Cities of this Country, he came hither, with intent to reſide a while at my Fathers Court. His excellent ſociety, and generous behaviour, ſoon made him to be taken notice of, as the moſt conſiderable ſtranger had been ſeen at <hi>Mantua</hi> for many years; and if his great endowments of mind, with an unaffected gracefulneſs of carriage in all his actions, attended with a moſt complaiſant humility, procured him the Eſteem and Reſpect of all vertuous men: His youth adorned with a beauty more than natural to his ſex, and his winning Converſation purchaſed him, if not the Affection, at leaſt the favourable Opinion of all our <hi>Mantuan</hi> Ladies; and there were, (as I have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) very few, if any, whoſe affections were not preinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but would willingly have been content to make him the diſpoſer of their liberty. He was very aſſiduous in attending at the Court, from the firſt night of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance there, which chanc'd to be when my Father by a publick celebration of his birth-day, allowed a more than uſual freedom in his Palace. He was permitted to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56696:9"/>
daunce with me, being lookt upon as a ſtranger of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and then (as he ſince told me,) he embraced thoſe chains were relinquiſht with his life: after ſome weeks ſtay with us, the high Character every one gave of him, and thoſe Remarkes my Father himſelf had taken of his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary parts, made him deſirous to retain ſo eminent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alwayes near him, by heaping continual honours dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on him; inſomuch that he was quickly beheld, not only one of the greateſt Officers of the Court, but the Dukes peculiar Favourite: and to oblige him from any thoughts of returning to <hi>Sicily,</hi> the place of his Birth and Fortunes, my Father deſigned a match for him with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelinda,</hi> the only Daughter of Count <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the moſt eminent man within his territories. But his humility, (as was then believed,) made him, though with great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements excuſe the acceptance of what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf too unworthy of deſerving. But his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ſerved only to incite my Father with greater ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs to bring him to the acceptance of what he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo advantagious for him; and having acquainted the Old Count with his Deſires, it was not only accepted of by him, but he ſeem'd overjoyed with the thoughts of having ſo accompliſht a Son-in-law, and one ſo highly in his Princes favour; ſo that all was in a manner conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before <hi>Frederick</hi> knew the Dukes reſolutions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummating what he himſelf had very little inclination to. <hi>Roſelinda</hi> had been bred up with me as a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from our Childhood, but the reſerv'dneſs of her diſpoſition had kept me ignorant of thoſe Concerns ſhe was at laſt in gratitude obliged to give me the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of; which made me at firſt ſtrangely wonder ſhe could harbour an averſion againſt a perſon like <hi>Frederick,</hi> believing there was not a Lady about the Court did not envy her fortune. 'Tis true, when I firſt heard the Dukes reſolutions, I was not unwilling to reſign <hi>Roſelinda</hi> to a Husband ſo well deſerved her; though I muſt confeſs at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56696:9"/>
that very time, whether (as I was willing to believe) the particular kindneſs I had for her, made me loth ſpeedily to looſe her; or whether it was the ſecret im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of a growing Inclination for him, I could not conſent to be pleaſed with an overhaſty concluſion of their Marriage. But why ſhould I endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the declaration of what has occaſion'd all my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; 'tis enough Dear <hi>Niſe,</hi> that I have told how much <hi>Frederick</hi> deſerved, for you to gueſs I was not the only unſenſible perſon (of thoſe had been ſtrangers to Love untill his appearance) at Court; Alas I ſaw him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed ſometimes with him in publick, heard from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one the praiſes of him, and was apt enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what the moſt affected could ſay in his behalf, ſhort of flattery; when I conſidered my Father a wiſe Prince gave that preference to him, a ſtranger and a youth, before his own Subjects, and whom years had made fitter by experience for a Princes Councel. This at firſt produced no other effect in me but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Eſteem, which (with bluſhes let me own it) inſenſibly increaſt to a violent paſſion; with what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance was my ſoul agitated when the day of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Wedding drew near; I ſigh'd, lamented to my ſelf, and by my own diſorder, made a general one through the Court, although it was only attributed to a melancholy I was always inclinable to; <q>What ſhall I do miſerable creature, (would I ſay to my ſelf) ſhall I wrong my own thoughts with letting them be entertained with imaginations ſo unworthy of me; ſhall the Heireſs to the Dukedom of <hi>Mantua</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an opinion prejudicial to her own quiet, for one ſo much inferiour to her? ſhall <hi>Diana</hi> wrong her ſelf by an injurious Kindneſs for a ſtranger; of whom ſhe knows nothing more than what a partial report of his worth has aquainted her with? No, no, fond Maid, let him Marry her he is deſigned to, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56696:10"/>
him for ever from thy mind and ſight.—But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las how can I do it, how can I tear from my breaſt an Inclination has taken ſo violent, and deep poſſeſſion of it? Or if I could obtain though with never ſo much difficulty, a conqueſt over my ſelf, why ſhould I ſtrive to do it? will I ever love, or can I think to be always free, no, 'tis impoſſible; I have already ſurrendred my heart to the moſt deſerving man on earth. I do, I muſt love him, and he is altogether worthy of it, were I Miſtreſs of the greateſt Empire the Sun gives Light to. But Oh doting woman (would my tormenting thoughts reply) he is deſtined to another, nor does he know, nay dares not imagine himſelf eſteem'd by thee, or if he did, perhaps his freedom is not now to be diſpoſed of or were it reſign'd to thee, he dares not declare, nor canſt thou derogate ſo much either from the greatneſs of thy Birth, or modeſty of thy Sex, to let him know it.</q> With this perplexity was my mind tortured, during the preparation for his Nuptials. There was not a young Lord about <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> who did not more envy <hi>Fredericks</hi> fortune in being deſtined to ſo fair a Bride, than for the advantage he had over them in my Fathers Love; while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeem'd leaſt tranſported with the expectation of thoſe joys he was ready to be poſſeſt of. I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Dear <hi>Niſe,</hi> the Paſſion I had for him, and with a grief equal to it, muſt let you know how it proved that gallant mans deſtruction. Finding it at laſt in vain to ſtruggle with Fate, I wiſht only an opportunity of letting him know he was more than indifferent to me, pleaſed with the imagination that <hi>Roſenlida</hi> had more of his Reſpect than Love. But my Fathers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Caution kept me eſtranged from the converſation of any but thoſe of my own Sex, who were kept near me either as Companions or Attendants, except at ſome peculiar times, (while he himſelf was by,) he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56696:10"/>
admitted to my preſence ſome of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons about his Court, where I had permiſſion to hear their diſcourſe without liberty of anſwering to any of them, but himſelf; as what he thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the modeſty of a young Virgin, and his Daughter; only his new Favourite had the allowance of ſpeaking in publick to me, and commanded to entertain his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs before my face; a freedom, I was not much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with, and what had never before been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any one who received a Wife from his Court. However I had thereby an opportunity of obſerving his behaviour towards her, in which I was not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find there was more of a profound Reſpect, than any appearance of a real Paſſion. I then began to uſe <hi>Roſelinda</hi> with a ſeeming endearment more than I had formerly done, and attempting when we were alone to learn from her what progreſs <hi>Fredrick</hi> had made towards the gaining her affections; I was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied to underſtand neither the one nor the other wiſht a Conſummation of their Marriage, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durſt oppoſe the reſolution of thoſe that had an abſolute Command over them: this diſcovery ſerved but to kindle that into a flame, which before burnt ſecretly with a glowing fervour in my breaſt; I allowed <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> altogether worthy of me, and was willing to gueſs from her diſcourſe that he had uſed more than a common Reſpect in thoſe occaſions where my name had been mentioned between them, nor could I avoid being ſo partial to my ſelf, as to believe I had many advantages beſides that of my Birth over <hi>Roſelinda,</hi> which might not have been lookt on with indifference by her intended Bridegroom. While I continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this hidden oppreſſion, without the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of hope to find a remedy, and ſtrove in vain to expel the thoughts of that bewitching man from my heart, the Day appeared which was to be the eye
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56696:11"/>
of his Wedding, when I perceived <hi>Roſelinda</hi> grown more penſive than ever, as if ſhe fear'd the approach of that hour I imagined would have been fatal only to me; and being earneſt (if poſſible) to diſcover the cauſe of it, I took her apart with me into my Cloſet, and conjured her by the Love and Reſpect ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expreſt to me, that the Secret of her grief might be entruſted to one vowed her all the friendſhip and kindneſs her condition was capable of receiving. My entreaties were ſo prevalent that at laſt ſhe confeſt, (with a ſhower of tears,) the love of <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> (whom you knew) made her rather wiſh for death than an eternal loſs of one ſo dear to her, and of whoſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhe wanted no aſſurance; ſhe let me know the circumſtances of her Paſſion with ſo much grief and tenderneſs, that had I been leſs concerned then I was to prevent what ſhe ſo much feared, I ſhould not have been able to deny her all the aſſiſtance poſſible in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing her Marriage with <hi>Frederick,</hi> but when in vain we had conſulted all ways that had the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of proving ſucceſsful in doing it, ſhe declared her reſolution of flying from her Father, and Countrey with <hi>Aſtolfo,</hi> rather than infringe the Vows ſhe had made him, and be ſacrificed to one ſhe could never love; we both concluded no remedy could be expected any other way, although the dangers and difficulties of that were too great to be haſtily reſolved on; and though I cannot deny but I wiſht it, yet I could never bring my ſelf to encourage their being expoſed either to the ill conſequences of ſuch a voluntary Baniſhment, or the rage of a Prince and Father who would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually cruel in the puniſhment of them, ſhould they ever again fall into his hands; and at laſt my Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wrought ſo far upon me, that I perſwaded her to a reſolution, (with anxiety enough,) that was to make us both miſerable; to ſubmit to that of our Fathers,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56696:11"/>
letting her know withal that if ſhe was given from one ſhe ſo intirely loved, ſhe at the ſame time rob'd me of a man, that were I at my own diſpoſe, I ſhould not think unworthy of my favour. She expreſt great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements for the confidence I had repoſed in her, and left me with a ſeeming reſolution of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the councel I had given her of Obedience, and I remained all that day overwhelmed with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſo unhappy a Reſolve had thrown me into, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering my ſelf to be ſeen by any body. That evening a while after it was dark, I was acquainted that <hi>Roſelinda</hi> with a Kinswoman of hers, and ſtranger to the Court, beg'd admittance to me; with a deſire of acquainting me in private with ſomething that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nearly concern'd me as much as her ſelf. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a little what ſhould occaſion ſo unexpected a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit from her, but more at the mention of that ſtranger was in her company, and ordering them to be brought into my Cloſet, you will believe I was ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to diſcover, notwithſtanding the diſguiſe, that <hi>Frederick</hi> was the pretended relation ſhe brought with her. So extraordinary a preſumption raiſed a diſturbance in me, which ſhe eaſily diſcovered by the frowns I welcomed her and her audacious gueſs with, who immediately threw himſelf at my feet, with all the languiſhing geſtures of a violent Paſſion, but durſt not ſpeak a word in his own Excuſe, of a good while, his Conductor as much ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through the fear of having highly offended me. During his continuance in that poſture, a violent Combat between Love and Reſpect, had diſordered all the faculties of my ſoul; and had I given way to the firſt dictates of my Reſentment, I had called for guards to ſeize him, and delivered him up a prey to the utmoſt rigour of my Father, who was but too nice in ſuch circumſtances of honour, which his rudeneſs had violated. But when I began to yield to more tender

thoughts, I found it impoſſible for me to think of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the life of one Heaven had decreed I muſt ever Love; and withal, induced by a Curioſity not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to our Sex, I was willing to underſtand the deſign of his appearing before me in ſuch a Dreſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being brought in by one I believed was the next morning to be his Wife. While my heart was agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theſe conſiderations, ſtill ſuſpenſive whether I ſhould declare in favour of one I loved, or condemn his preſumption with an immediate baniſhment for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from my ſight, he remained kneeling at my feet, not daring to ſpeak a word, untill upon my making a ſign to him to quit the poſture he was in, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a violent compulſion of himſelf he ſaid trembling; <q>I acknowledge Divineſt Princeſs, my offence has ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly merited death, and I am ready at your Command to reſign that life muſt not be worth preſerving if you ſentence it to a diſſolution.</q> Whatever difficulty he found in uttering theſe words, mine would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much greater in returning an anſwer, had not <hi>Roſelinda</hi> prevented my doing of it, who undertaking to ſay ſomething for both their vindications, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a thouſand times begg'd my forgiveneſs of a crime neceſſity had compell'd her to the commiſſion of, finding I ſeemed attentive to what ſhe was about to ſpeak, acquainted me that after her leaving the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in the morning, not being able to reſolve on what ſhe had ſeemingly promiſed, and <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> finding means to give her a private Viſit, overcome by her Lovers tears and perſwaſions, ſhe had determined rather to give her life an Oblation to her Fathers diſpleaſure, than her hand to any one but him that had the engagement both of that and her heart. In the mean time <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> having reſolutions not much different from hers, ſought to obtain a private conference with her, whoſe admittance met with little obſtruction in the family, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56696:13"/>
knowing him to be very ſuddenly her Husband; and her own Maid ignorant of <hi>Aſtolpho</hi>'s being there, waited on him to her Chamber; where they were all ſufficiently amazed at ſo unexpected an Encounter of each other: And that finding it would be too dangerous for her to conceal her thoughts any longer, ſhe confeſſed to <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the perſon he beheld there, was one to whom ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded too great proofs of her affection, ever to let it be beſtowed upon any other; and that he appeared ſo far from being diſpleaſed with her frank declaration in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Rival, that after a long obliging diſcourſe, he offer'd to contribute what lay in his power, towards the prevention of two Lovers being ruined, who were determined rather to dye than admit of a ſeparation. That at laſt not being able to imagine any poſſibility of avoiding a forced marriage, if they continued in <hi>Mantua, Aſtolfo</hi> had prevailed ſo far with her, as ſhe conſented to fly with him both from her Friends and Country; but would not ſtir without my allowance of it, and 'till ſhe had taken a long farewel of me; that her Lover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone to provide Horſes, and what elſe was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their flight; <hi>Frederick</hi> remaining alone with her had owned, that the Adoration he had for me occaſioned the indifference towards her, which appeared in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage from the firſt mention of the Dukes intention to make her his Wife. And whether ſhe imagined in her ſelf after that diſcovery I had made her of my Love, that it might not be very diſpleaſing to me, if I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him unobſerved by any Witneſſes; or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, (as ſhe endeavoured to pretend) by the earneſt perſwaſions of that paſſionate man, ſhe dreſſed him in ſome of her own Clothes, (his youth and the comlineſs of his perſon contributing to help the diſguiſe,) and brought him, untaken notice of by any, to accompany her to my Appartment. It were needleſs for me to repeat the particulars of our Diſcourſe, which perhaps were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56696:14"/>
but too tender on my ſide; therefore let it ſuffice that you know <hi>Frederick</hi> having learned from her, as ſhe own'd, that he was not indifferent to me; made ſo good Uſe of his diſcovery, and expreſt his own Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with ſo endearing a tenderneſs, that I was induced to forgive <hi>Roſelinda</hi> the betraying of my thoughts, and granted permiſſion to that Inſinuating Lover, once more in the like diſguiſe to ſee me; after the diſturbance was over, which we very well knew <hi>Roſelindaes</hi> departure would make in the Court. So taking my laſt farewel of her, not without Tears at ſo fatal a departure, and my hearty Prayers for her ſucceſs; while I retired to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what had paſt, and recollect my ſelf after ſo ſtrange and bold an Adventure, they went back to her Fathers, that he might change his dreſs for one more ſuitable for him. Where, as he informed me afterwards, having put on his own Clothes, and hearing the <hi>Count</hi> was returned from the Court, he made him a Viſit, as if newly come into the Houſe for that purpoſe only, and to wait on his intended <hi>Bride.</hi> The good Old man receiving him with the welcome of a fond Father, ſent for <hi>Roſelinda</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him, and was ſufficiently rejoyced to find ſuch an alteration in his Daughters Countenance, as appearing more pleaſant than he had obſerved her ſince the firſt propoſal of their Marriage. After a convenient ſtay <hi>Frederick</hi> took his leave, and the fond Old-man retiring to Bed, <hi>Roſelinda</hi> withdrew, to prepare for her intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Journey. The next morning was attended with a Diſorder not at all leſs than we had imagined, when thoſe who entred the Brides Chamber to dreſs her for her Nuptials, found her miſſing, without any account to be learnt what was become of her, more, than that <hi>Aſtolfo,</hi> long ſuſpected as her Lover, was ſuppoſed to have conveyed her away, having been ſeen on Horſe-back the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about <hi>Theophilus</hi>'s Houſe: Poſts were diſpatched forthwith to all parts, and an Embargo laid on the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56696:14"/>
Ships and Veſſels in every Port within the Dukes Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories: with large promiſes of Reward to whoever ſhould diſcover them, and Death threatned to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealers of the Fugitives. But their utmoſt Endeavours proved wholly unſucceſsful, and thoſe poor perſecuted Lovers were never heard of to this day; which gives me too much cauſe of fear that they came to ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy end, ſince both her Father and mine (their only Enemies,) have been long dead. I muſt confeſs I could not but be pleaſed to underſtand how every conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon about the Court came, as much to condole with <hi>Frederick</hi> for the loſs of his Miſtreſs, as with Count <hi>Theophilus</hi> for that of an only Daughter. The diſappointed Bridegroom diſſembling with ſo much cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſatisfaction, that there was none but concluded the Raviſher, (for ſo <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> was termed,) would meet a rigorous deſtiny from his hands, if he ever fortuned to be diſcovered. If this accident tranſported my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the height of rage againſt <hi>Roſelinda</hi> and her Lover, it contributed to ſettle <hi>Frederick</hi> more in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than ever, uſing all the endearments imaginable to make him forget his Loſs, with aſſurance he would loſe no occaſion of gaining a Wife for him, more rich and beautiful than her had been ſtole from him; little ſuſpecting he had not been deficient in doing that for himſelf. When all things began to be a little quieted, <hi>Fredericks</hi> diſturbance commenced in ſeeking wayes how he might privately ſee me, without being too much obſerved; His former diſguiſe was ſhelter enough from being known to any body; but who to pretend himſelf, was a difficulty long a reſolving, and two months paſt without his attainment of what he ſo much longed for; till in the end, grown impatient of delay, he found out <hi>Roſelinda's</hi> Maid, who had been privy to her eſcape, and with large Gifts and Promiſes believed he had ſecured her to be faithful both in aſſiſting him, and concealing his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56696:15"/>
deſign. She, by his direction viſiting one of my Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had not been long at Court, and ſcarce knew any body, told her a young Lady newly arrived at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> in her way to <hi>Rome,</hi> was very ambitious of kiſſing my hand, but deſired it might be when I was moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, urging it for her Modeſty, and that being on a journey ſhe was unprovided of thoſe Ornaments a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Appearance required. The Innocent Woman having promiſed to comply with the Strangers requeſt, came to beg my permiſſion to introduce her, when I ſhould be alone. The ſudden apprehenſion I had that <hi>Frederick</hi> was the Viſitant, put me into ſome diſorder, conſidering the danger ſo raſh a Venture expoſed us both to; but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of my ſelf inclinable to hear the renewed Vows of that ſincere Lover, and not willing to deny him a Favour he had my Promiſe of permitting, aſſured by thoſe ſilent expreſſions he made me underſtand in publick, that the delay his Viſit had met with was no ſmall Torment to him; I gave permiſſion, that in the Evening ſhe ſhould bring the Stranger Lady to me; which ſhe did without the leaſt ſuſpition of his being other than what was pretended; while one or two of my Women waited at ſome diſtance in the Room, I only diſcourſed my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Counterfeit about her Country, and the deſign of her Travel; who readily pretended a life not without ſome extraordinary adventures, but ſuch as though ſhe would not deny me the knowledge of, yet were of that conſequence as not to be imparted to any one elſe. Whereupon willing to remove the reſtraint he was in, I retired to my Cloſet with a ſeeming deſign to learn her Story. Ah <hi>Niſe!</hi> when he found himſelf at liberty to ſpeak; had you beheld his joyfully tranſported carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and heard thoſe endearing ſupplications he made kneeling at my Feet, you would have allowed his Love too ſincere and tender, to be rejected by one leſs partial than mine had made me, in what concerned that Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56696:15"/>
man. I muſt confeſs the declaration of his Love this ſecond time was with that cautious reſpect and winning endearment, as made it impoſſible for me to keep him longer ignorant of the Place he had in my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. I am ſenſible the World would have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me for ſo haſty an owning my Inclination, though it had approved him worthy of me: but alas, my reſtraint was ſuch, that I could never promiſe him nor my ſelf a poſſibility of ſeeing him (where I might ſpeak) again, without the hazard of both our ſafeties. It would be needleſs to repeat all he ſaid to me in this Viſit; and as to my ſelf let it ſuffice I tell you, his Conqueſt over me was ſuch, that he took his Leave with an Aſſurance from me that I would never yield my ſelf a Wife to any but <hi>Frederick,</hi> though that could not poſſibly be hoped while my Father lived. He was very deſirous of ſeeing me once more, in the ſame diſguiſe, but there appeared ſo many dangerous inconveniencies in it, that we could not reſolve when or how he might hope the Fortune of another ſuch Meeting. After this a Month paſt in which he only could behold me in publick while my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was preſent, none preſuming to come near my Apartment but thoſe my Father was pleaſed to bring with him when he came to me, where <hi>Frederick</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aſſiduous to let his Eyes and Looks acquaint me with what his Tongue durſt not mention. But both growing Impatient of brooking ſuch a conſtrained reſervedneſs, without the opportunity of ſometimes a more free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, I took an occaſion to let him know I would be the following Evening in this Iſland, whither if he could privately convey himſelf, he ſhould meet me unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in one of the Cloſe Walks: you may be ſure he was punctual to the Aſſignment, and in this very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour it was we took an Eternal Farewel of each other. While we were here he told me of <hi>Roſelinda's</hi> Maids death, not without ſuſpicion of Poyſon, (the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56696:16"/>
that knew he pretended to be favour'd by me) but then we were apt to imagine it the effect of <hi>Theophilus</hi> Revenge, who might ſuſpect her privy to the Eſcape <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his Daughter; but that miſerable Wretch received her death as a reward of her Treachery to us. We had not been here half an hour, when interrupted by more than an uſual Noiſe, I went out to one of the Walks from whence I could ſee the River, where I was ſufficient affrighted to perceive my Father landing from his Barge at the Garden-ſtairs. His coming was a thing ſo unuſual, that fearing ſomething dangerous to us, I haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to warn <hi>Frederick</hi> of concealing himſelf, while, in no little Diſorder, I paſt through the Walks to meet my Father as far as I could from that part of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; aſſoon as I came near him, methought there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a ſeriouſneſs in his Looks more than at other times, but concluding my own fear raiſed that Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I walkt with him, endeavouring to behave my ſelf with as much unconcern'dneſs as my Fears would let me, which increaſed to perceive his Curioſity carry him through every Walk in the Iſland, holding me ſtill by the Hand, without ſo much as ſpeaking one Word, when he had taken a full Survey of the Garden, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned carrying me with him to the Palace, where he aſſumed again his wonted Temper, and I thought all things had been as ſecure as could be wiſhed. But Oh Heavens! what was my Condition! what was my Grief and Deſpair the next Morning! when being about to riſe, one of my Women told me, as a misfortune all were troubled at, that <hi>Frederick</hi> was the Night before murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, going from the Palace to his Lodgings; and that the Guard had ſeen his body thrown into the River, not knowing who it was, 'till going to ſeize the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellers, who all made their eſcape, they found a Sword which was known to be his, but himſelf could no where be heard of. I was immediately like one Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſtruck,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56696:16"/>
and remained in my Bed with more appearance of having followed him to Eternity, than of any Life remaining in me. All my Women being ſenſibly afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my Concern, began to blame her had ſo impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently told me what had occaſioned it, concluding my Surprize and the Tenderneſs of my Nature the ſole cauſe of that grief I had expreſt for the lamentable death of one my Father ſo much valued; and coming a little to my ſelf, I ſtrove ſo far with my Sorrows to confirm them in their belief, that not one of them ſurmized any thing of the truth; and telling them I would not riſe till my diſturbance was a little remov'd, they left me alone, to renew that Grief I could not have ſuppreſt much longer. It would be too tedious for me to relate all that my Deſpair and Torment for his Loſs made me utter. A thouſand times I wiſht my ſelf his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Death; But what gave me the moſt ſenſible diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was, through whoſe hatred he ſhould have been ſo barbarouſly deſtroy'd. He was generally beloved by all that knew him, neither could I imagine, had my Father been acquainted with his Love, he would have been ſo rigorous to a man he himſelf eſteem'd above all others. But I will only let thee know, my ſorrow grew ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent by ſtriving to ſuppreſs it, that it was attended with a Fever which confined me ſome weeks to my Bed; during which, my Fathers Grief was in appearance little inferiour to that I languiſhed under, ſeeming to uſe his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to diſcover the Murderers. Nor was his Concern leſs for my Indiſpoſition, not owning that he was at all acquainted with the Cauſe of it. About five months were paſt before I began to appear abroad, when I was afreſh aſſaulted by a fit of ſickneſs which had ſeized on my Father, and which proved in the end fatal to him. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring near a month that he lay ill, I continually attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his Bedſide, and diſcovered by his frequent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though darkly uttered, that an inward Diſquiet of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56696:17"/>
mind hindred any good effects which Medicines might work toward the removing his diſtemper; and at laſt when he found his death near approaching, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all to quit the Room but my ſelf, taking and preſſing my hand, while a flood of Tears iſſued from his weak eyes: Ah my <hi>Diana!</hi> (ſaid he) with what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort might I now have died, had not the miſery I am loaded with been procured by my own precipitated rage. Thou knoweſt how much I prized the unfortunate <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> and perhaps in time might not have thought him unfit to be thy Husband. But oh dire diſcovery; <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> examining his Daughters Maid about her flight, uſing both Promiſes and Threats, extorted a confeſſion from her, that you and <hi>Frederick</hi> were both privy to it; and bringing her privately to me, I learnt, with ſorrow, the Conferences that unhappy man had with you in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, which was aggravated with ſuch undoubted cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that I had no reaſon to doubt the truth of what ſhe related; but reſolving to be throughly ſatisfied before I executed that rigor I thought to a ſin of ſo high a Nature, was due; I imployed <hi>Theophilus</hi> to obſerve both your actions; who, I muſt tell you, though I had forgiven the Maids Offence in aſſiſting <hi>Frederick</hi> to get to you, He would not that of aiding his Daughter in her running away, but by a lingring Poyſon ſent her to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; and to be revenged of the injury he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Frederick</hi> had done him, continually incited me to puniſh his inſolence of pretending to your Love by ſuch clandeſtine wayes as he had made uſe of; ſo that at laſt yielding to his perſwaſions, being overcome by too nice a ſence of Honour, I reſolved, if I ever diſcovered him to be again with you, that his Life ſhould anſwer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; and that diligent man hearing of his going alone to the Iſland, incited me to follow and take him there with you; which though I miſt of effecting, upon certain advice that he had met with you there, I was ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56696:17"/>
exaſperated, that (though I diſſembled my anger) reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of ruining him began to poſſeſs my mind, and ſending for <hi>Theophilus</hi> he ſo confirmed me in the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I had conceived againſt him, that I gave him leave to uſe him as an enemy to his Prince, and aſſaulter of his honour. What followed (ſaid he weeping) thou too well knoweſt, and from the hour of his death I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived one of conſolation, wiſhing the Sword that pierc'd his Breaſt had been levell'd at my own; nor could I ever brook the ſight of <hi>Theophilus</hi> after that fatal night; which joyned to the loſs of his Daughter, and a ſenſe of Guilt for the innocent blood he had ſhed, ſtruck him into ſo deep a Melancholy, that he outlived my Dear <hi>Frederick</hi> but a few Weeks. Here he ended his Diſcourſe, accompanying that renewed Grief I was poſſeſt with, at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my Fathers being the Murderer (as I lookt on him) of the beſt man had ever lived. But if his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance made me behold my Father with a growing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, the weakneſs of his Condition, and the real penitence he ſhewed for what had been allowed by him to be committed, made me turn all my Anger to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, becoming a dutiful Child to a dying Parent: he continued two days after he had given me this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Fredericks</hi> death, and then reſigned his Soul to Heaven, and his Dukedom to her who has enjoyed ſmall ſatisfaction from that Dignity ſince deprived of what would have been a happineſs much more conſiderable.</p>
               <p>The afflicted Dutcheſs making this ſad end of her Narration, perceived by the Tears of her beloved <hi>Niſe</hi> that ſhe had as equal a ſhare in her Misfortunes as if they had been the circumſtances of her own Life. But if the compaſſionate <hi>Niſe</hi> accompanied the Concluſion of her Ladys Hiſtory with the greateſt expreſſions of a real Grief for her Misfortunes: the fair afflicted Dutcheſs could not reſiſt an unbounded Sorrow, at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thoſe diſaſters ſeemed to deny any future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56696:18"/>
to her Life. They continued a great while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbing one another in their pitiful Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and doubtleſs the whole day had been ſpent by the ſorrowful <hi>Diana</hi> in that ſad Contemplation, if her Favourite, recollecting her ſelf, had not conſidered how late it was, and how much Company attended the Dutcheſſes return to her Palace; and withal to divert her thoughts from what ſhe believed the remembrance of was ſo prejudicial to her: She at laſt with much intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſwaded her to go back from the Garden, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to conceal, as much as poſſible, the diſorder ſhe was in, from all Beholders. At her arrival there, thoſe Princes, who, attracted by her Beauty and the greatneſs of her Fortune, reſided at her Court, in hopes that a happy Poſſeſſor of both, would be choſe from among them; came to welcom her Return from a place they wiſhed ſhe would take leſs pleaſure in, ſince ſhe had required their deſiſting from following her thither at any time. Her obliging goodneſs was not wanting in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing a complaiſance to them equal to their quality; though none could promiſe himſelf any advancement in his Love from one who deſired to appear very averſe from an intention of altering her condition: and while they ſtudied to outvy one another in Grandeur and State, each ſtriving to make himſelf more remarkable than the reſt of his Rivals; the ſorrowful Dutcheſs beſtowed all the Leaſure, buſineſs of her Government would allow, on the cruel remembrance of her unhappy Lover, who though ſhe knew long ſince dead, had a ſhare in her Breaſt much beyond what any Living One could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>The Meſſenger that was ſent by the Dutcheſs, to learn a more particular account of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Maſſacre than what the Countryman had related, being returned juſt as the Dutcheſs was retiring from thoſe Crowds had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her Palace upon her dining with the Princes in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56696:18"/>
publick, which ſometimes ſhe knew not how to excuſe, when requeſted by them; gave her an account of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> Cruelty, little different from what ſhe had heard before; whoſe barbarous ſeverity ſo much incenſed her, that ſhe was about to give immediate Order to have him committed to a publick Execution, as his wickedneſs had in all appearance juſtly deſerved. But <hi>Ceſario,</hi> his faithful Friend, being newly come from the Priſon where he was confined, and at the ſame time She was going to pronounce Sentence; throwing himſelf at her Feet, he humbly beſought her to reſpite his Doom till ſhe heard what his Inducements were to commit that Fact he was to ſuffer for. But although he made Uſe of all the Arguments a generous Friendſhip could ſtore him with, they were not prevalent enough to obtain the deferring that juſtice the Princeſs thought was not fit to be delaid, where the guilt appeared ſo notorious; until the Stranger Princes joyned their interceſſion, withal urging, that his Puniſhment a while ſuſpended would ſatisfie her better than to wiſh it undone, if he ſhould prove an object fitter for Her Mercy than the Laws Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; which <hi>Ceſario</hi> affirmed to be moſt certain. So that at laſt her Compaſſion prevailing above her Severe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſhe returned with the Princes, and being ſeated with them on her ſides, <hi>Ceſario</hi> by her command related the particulars of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Life, to that fatal Accident had expoſed it to ſo eminent danger.</p>

               <p>MAdam, what I ſhall acquaint your Highneſs with of that Unfortunate man is now a Delinquent to your Laws, will, I queſtion not, make him appear to you more Unhappy than Wicked; eſpecially if you will pleaſe to allow that one Nobly Born ought not to be without a ſenſe of Honour, and endeavour the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, when aſſaulted in the higheſt nature; but that you may be more fully informed of it, and the real Worth of him I plead for, your Highneſs muſt give me permiſſion to begin with the firſt paſſages of his Life, and I believe you will find ſomething diverting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in the Relation I ſhall make.</p>
               <p>There are few can boaſt more advantages from a good Education than he is Maſter of, in which his Father took all imaginable care to have his Endowments equal to the conſiderable Rank his Birth had placed him in. After a convenient time employed at home in thoſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were fit for him, he was ſent abroad to learn thoſe Accompliſhments the Theory alone is to be had from Books; but after a few years employed in Travel, the Death of his Father called him Home, to the poſſeſſion of a large Inheritance; where his obliging carriage ſoon procured the commendation of all the City, every one ſtriving to be reckoned in the number of his Friends; but an unexpected accident quickly after his return, removed that tranquillity he had till then been attended with. A Formal young Gallant of the City, very well
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56696:20"/>
attended, by chance paſſing through a Principal Street, met <hi>Alexander</hi> at that time alone, who diverted by the ſight of a Lady looking from a Window, took not ſo much notice of the Complement that Gentleman made him of his Hat in going by, as to return the like Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; which being lookt on as a ſlighting rudeneſs, made the Gentleman turn back and give him ſome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding Language, which <hi>Alexander</hi> confident he had not deſerved, returned him ſuch ſharp Replies, that from words they came to make Uſe of their Swords, whereby <hi>Alexander,</hi> being fallen upon by all that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his Opponent, received ſeveral wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Company in the Street could get in to part them; but at laſt a Croud getting together, his Enemies ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for themſelves, while he not able to go far, ſlipt into the Porch of an adjacent Houſe, and ſo to the Yard, before thoſe that were come in to ſeparate them, had laid hold of him. As he ſtood there looking about whither to go for ſome help, finding his ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to fail by the loſs of his blood, he perceived the door of a Hall open, and leaning on his Sword went toward it, to get ſome of the Houſe to call a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon to him; but he was ſcarce entred, when through weakneſs and pain, he fell down in a Swoon. There happened to ſit in the Hall a young Lady, who ſhrieking at the ſight of a man entring with a naked Sword, and all over bloody, brought in the Servants, whoſe coming was very opportune for the wounded ſtranger; ſoon after the Maſter of the Houſe, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the young Lady, being advertiſed of what had happened, came down, and ſeeing the condition he was in, Ordered him to be laid in a Bed, and ſending for Chirurgeons, with much pains they brought him to himſelf, when ſearching his wounds, they judged his greateſt danger was the loſs of ſo much blood; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he would have been carried home, but that the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56696:21"/>
Chirurgeons ſaid it might indanger his life, and <hi>Octavio</hi> generouſly declared, he ſhould not leave his Houſe, till he ſaw him in a better condition, ſince Providence had been pleaſed to direct him thither. And his Care and Kindneſs, with his Chirurgeons diligence, within few days raiſed him from his Bed, ſo that he reſolved with great acknowledgements to <hi>Octavio,</hi> to return again to his own Houſe, for the perfecting his Cure. But <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi> on the other ſide, perſiſted in his Noble humour of not letting him ſtir till he was perfectly well, ſo that he was compell'd to ſtay longer than he deſired at that time, being withal not a little ſolicitous to hear what was become of his Adverſary, whom he reſolved to call to a ſevere account for his baſeneſs, as ſoon as his ſtrength would permit. One morning as he was buſying himſelf with ſuch Thoughts, his Meditations were interrupted by a Charming Voice he heard at ſome diſtance, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the ſound of a Lute, play'd on by no mean Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt. His Curioſity preſently made him deſire to learn who it was had given him ſo pleaſing a diverſion. And leaving his own Chamber, he paſt through a large Gallery, at the end of which he heard the delightful Muſick, as he gueſſed, from a Room that opened to the place where he was; the Voice he knew to be a Womans; and imagined, as it really was, That <hi>Porcia, Octavio</hi>'s Daughter, had ignorantly given him that delightful entertainment; and being earneſt, if poſſible, to have a ſight of the Perſon had drawn him thither, he went ſoftly to the door, which he ſaw was ſhut; and looking through the Key-hole, beheld a young Lady, whoſe beauty he thought much tranſcended all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had ſeen of Lovely before, which was increaſed by the negligent poſture he beheld her in, drying ſome tears ſeem'd to force a paſſage from her Languiſhing eyes. He had not long contemplated on this lovely Object, when ſeeing a Maid come in to her, whom he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56696:21"/>
knew to be the ſame aſſiſted often near him during his ſickneſs, and fearing either to be heard, or that the door where he ſtood ſhould be opened; the caution of avoiding any thing might look like rudeneſs in a Houſe where he was ſo much Reſpected, made him retire back to his own Chamber, though not without uſing a little compulſion to himſelf, in leaving a place he could have wiſhed a longer continuance in. After he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time contemplated on the Charms of that fair Lady he had ſo unexpectedly ſeen, and who he was confident muſt be <hi>Porcia,</hi> his Friends Daughter. <hi>Octavio</hi> came in to Viſit and Accompany him at his Dinner, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time of the day; at the end of which, <hi>Phillis,</hi> (the ſame who uſed to come to him, and her he had not long before ſeen in the Ladys Chamber) came in, and preſented him a Basket of curious Flowers, deſiring he would accept and value them as the firſt Fruits of the Spring in her Maſters Garden. He received the gift at firſt as a Complement of the Maids, for which he thought the Return of a more conſiderable preſent would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, which he could not then perform, <hi>Octavio</hi> being with him; but ſetting the Basket on a Table, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Maids kindneſs, he continued to entertain <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> being then leſs ſolicitous to leave him than before, which was not diſpleaſing to the good old Gentleman, who after a convenient time from Dinner, leaving <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> to repoſe himſelf he went to do the like in his own Chamber; as ſoon as he was gone <hi>Alexander</hi> looking by chance on the Flowers, found them placed in the Basket with ſo much Curioſity, as required him to look more attentively on them, when he was ſurpriſed to find in a mixture of Gilliflowers and Jeſſamine a Compoſition of theſe Words, <hi>It is enough to the Diſcreet.</hi> Although he concluded it came from <hi>Porcia,</hi> both by the perſon that brought it, and having ſeen in her Chamber, Flowers ſcattered on the Floor; yet he could not reſolve to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56696:22"/>
himſelf ſo fortunate, to look on it as a Favour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd him, or an incouragement to that Love he found began to take poſſeſſion of his Breaſt; However, willing to diſcover what the meaning might be, he reſolved to return an anſwer the ſame way; ſo that taking out all the Flowers, he put in the bottom of the Basket a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter filled with all the paſſionate Expreſſions a growing Love could dictate to him, and laying the Flowers on the top in the ſame order he received them, only alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words; and that Evening <hi>Phillis</hi> coming into his Chamber, after engaging her his by a conſiderable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he prevailed with her to carry the Basket to her young Lady, who ſhe confeſs'd had ſent it to him: which ſhe immediately did, and delivering it to <hi>Porcia</hi> ſhe read her own words varied to theſe, <hi>The Flowers conceal it;</hi> and meeting under them with his Letter, ſhe found his declaration of Love diſcovered with the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and moſt aggravated endearment imaginable; which was not diſpleaſing to her, when <hi>Phillis</hi> aſſured her it might be believed real, giving her an account of what ſhe learnt from <hi>Alexander,</hi> of his having both ſeen and heard her at the Gallery door. Whether it was <hi>Porcia's</hi> reſtraint made her more ready to receive an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Love, or whether her own diſpoſition was eaſily ſuſceptible of that paſſion; but as <hi>Alexander</hi> learnt afterwards from her Maid, the Declaration of his Love made an entire Conqueſt over that too-eaſie woman, who after having ſeveral times read his Letter, ſaid to her Confident, <hi>Phillis,</hi> Ah Heavens! what Gueſs did my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes bring into my Fathers Houſe! Ah what Charms haſt thou returned me under thoſe guilty Flowers! Ah <hi>Phillis, Alexander</hi> has conquered my Soul; I would fain be angry with my ſelf for thinking on him, and with Him for owning that he loves me; but he has done it with ſo winning and ſo reſpectful a grace, that I muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him; Ay, to my perpetual Torment I muſt do more,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56696:22"/>
I muſt love that bewitching man: and I cannot avoid conjuring thee by all the kindneſs thou haſt for me, to find out ſome means for him to ſpeak with me before he leaves our Houſe. Her Maid promiſed her obedience to that difficult Command, though ignorant how to bring it to paſs by reaſon of <hi>Octavio's</hi> cautious jealouſie, who was a continual Centinel over his Daughters actions; but at laſt it was reſolved, to bring him one Night to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia's</hi> Chamber when the old Gentleman was a-bed, but the very day before, whether he had taken notice of the Maids too often being with <hi>Alexander,</hi> or whether he thought him now well enough to remove, he came to him, and told him a Chair was ready to carry him home, and that he muſt conſent to that reconcilement he was newly come from concluding with his Enemy; the ſurprized Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knowing not how poſſibly to refuſe either, was forced to go that afternoon from the Houſe he then heartily wiſhed a longer reſidence in, but not able to find out any tolerable Excuſe, he obeyed <hi>Octavio's</hi> pleaſure with all the acknowledgements could be expreſſed for the great Favours and Kindneſs he had received from him, and took his leave, diſappointing both <hi>Porcia</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a meeting would have been agreeable enough to them. <hi>Alexander</hi> remained ſome days after his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val from <hi>Octavio's</hi> with the ſatisfaction of knowing now and then by a Letter, his Affection was ſo far from being diſpleaſing to her he had placed it on, that ſhe delighted in nothing more than the Conqueſt ſhe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſhe had made over him, and he has confeſs't to me that he wiſht then for nothing more than the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her, which he had almoſt fixt his reſolution of demanding from her Father, not doubting of being approved by him for a Son-in-Law. But fortune had otherwiſe decreed to diſpoſe of him, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the blemiſh of inconſtancy. About that time <hi>Carlos</hi> returned from a long Travel, to ſettle with a Family in

                  <hi>Mantua,</hi> called thither by the ſame occaſion had brought <hi>Alexander</hi> ſome time before, upon the death of a Father. They having, when abroad, travelled ſeveral journeys of pleaſure together, where ſo firm a friendſhip was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted between them, that it was now an equal joy to both, that in a more ſetled condition they ſhould injoy one anothers agreeable Converſation. At no time could one be ſeen without the other, and <hi>Carlos</hi> was alwayes to be found in <hi>Alexanders</hi> Houſe, or <hi>Alexander</hi> at that of <hi>Carlos,</hi> at leaſt that part of it he reſerved for his own Apartment, there being ſome Rooms he gave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to none into, where his fair Siſter <hi>Cynthia</hi> was, by his ſevere nicety, kept almoſt from the converſation of humane kind, not allowing her to frequent ſo much as any place of Devotion, further than a little Oratory within the Houſe, where from behind a Guilded Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſhe heard a Prieſt, by her Brothers order, aſſiſting as a Chaplain to her; yet, whether ſuch a Reſtraint was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to her, or that ſhe would not oppoſe in any thing the pleaſure of <hi>Carlos,</hi> whom ſhe eſteemed a Parent as well as a Brother, her hours met with Diverſions among her Maids, which hindred them from being tedious to her, while <hi>Carlos</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> employ'd theirs in thoſe Gallantries were ſuitable to their age, eſpecially <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> conſiſted in the favourable opportunity he had procured, by <hi>Phillis</hi>'s contrivance, of Diſcourſing every Evening with his Beloved <hi>Porcia, Carlos</hi> ſeldom leaving him alone in the night expoſed to thoſe Dangers often attend Intrigues of that Nature; and he was at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to ſo full a ſatisfaction through the winning car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Miſtreſs, that he determined out of hand to compleat both their happineſſes by demanding <hi>Octavio's</hi> permiſſion for the Conſummation of their Marriage; But having imparted the deſign to <hi>Carlos,</hi> whether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other ground, or only not to be rob'd of a Friend by ſeeing him retired to the Converſation of a Wife, he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56696:23"/>
endeavour'd to make him ſuſpend the too haſty purſuit of what he was then ſo earneſt for. One day as the two Friends were walking in a Gallery of <hi>Carlos,</hi> Houſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing about <hi>Alexanders</hi> Concern, he caſt his Eyes about the Walls to take a Survey of ſeveral curious pieces of Limning <hi>Carlos</hi> had brought with him from <hi>Rome,</hi> among which; he obſerved one Young Lady ſo beautiful, that at the firſt glance he rather attributed ſuch perfections as appeared Painted there, to the goodneſs of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans fancy, than a poſſibility that Nature had, or could ever form an Original equal to it; but asking <hi>Carlos</hi> if there had ever lived any thing like it, he told him it was a lively Copy of a Lady called <hi>Laura,</hi> who was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his firſt Love in <hi>Rome.</hi> Such Beauty (replied <hi>Alexander</hi>) might rather become the Adoration of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, than any one that were Mortal, and I could almoſt accuſe my Friend of Blaſphemy if I thought he had ever preſumed to acquaint her with his Love, at leaſt in any other tearms than ſuch as your Prayers are offered up to Heaven. <hi>Carlos</hi> ſmiled at his ſudden Tranſport, telling him ſhe was Mortal, and a Woman, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence liable to take the Impreſſion of Love, and to be overcome; but finding him to perſiſt in an Extravagant admiration only of a Picture, he perſwaded him into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Room to forget what he had ſeen; but from that time <hi>Alexanders</hi> thoughts were ſo wholly employed in contemplation of the Lovely Picture, that he was ſcarce ever out of <hi>Carlos</hi>'s Houſe, or the Gallery, where the two Friends being together one Afternoon, <hi>Alfredo,</hi> a near Relation of <hi>Porcia's</hi> came to viſit them, his chief Deſign being to engage <hi>Alexanders</hi> Mediation with <hi>Carlos,</hi> that he would beſtow his Siſter <hi>Cynthia</hi> on him for a Wife, he having taken a deep Impreſſion of Love, from a ſight of her in her return with her Brother, not long before, to <hi>Mantua. Alexander</hi> would willingly have obliged <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredo</hi> for his Couzens ſake, but knowing well the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56696:24"/>
temper of <hi>Carlos,</hi> he could not promiſe him any hopes of Succeſs; for although the Friendſhip between them was very great, <hi>Carlos</hi> had never given him a ſight of his Siſter, or ſo much as mention'd her being in the Houſe; however, he ſatisfied the Lover of <hi>Cynthia</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by aſſuring him to employ all his Intereſt with her Brother to make him happy. But <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf in the mean time had reſign'd all his Tranquillity to the imagined Beauty of <hi>Laura,</hi> not only owning it to his Friend, but with Proteſtations, that if their Friendſhip did not with-hold him, he would immediately viſit <hi>Rome</hi> in ſearch of this Lovely Creature, begging <hi>Carlos</hi> with the greateſt earneſtneſs poſſible, to give him an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical account of his Love, and the progreſſion he had made with her. <hi>Carlos</hi> found himſelf at a loſs what to ſay; but at laſt, a little to gratifie his perſeverance to know ſomething, he told him in general, that he had not been hated by her, that he had often found opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of ſeeing and Diſcourſing with her, but before he could perſwade her to a Reſolution of making him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, the death of his Father had called him from <hi>Rome</hi> and the Perſon he loved; withal perſwading <hi>Alexander</hi> to mention her no more to him, leſt it ſhould incite thoſe Thoughts he would unwillingly harbour againſt a Friend; <hi>Alexander</hi> promiſed he would not, ſtriving to put it off with a jeaſt, that what he had ſaid was only to try the Conſtancy of his Friends Love; and <hi>Carlos</hi> ſmiling, ſeemed to believe he had no other deſign in it. So fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that to other Diſcourſe, <hi>Alexander</hi> ſpoke to him in behalf of <hi>Alfredo</hi> for his Siſter; but <hi>Carlos</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to that Demand, that although he was well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied both of the Quality and Fortune of <hi>Alfredo,</hi> yet he would Impoſe no Husband upon his Siſter, but one ſhe ſhould her ſelf approve firſt, and that hearing <hi>Alfredo</hi> was then going a journey to <hi>Loretto,</hi> by the time of his return he would know his Siſters ſenſe, and accordingly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56696:24"/>
anſwer his Demand. This Journey of <hi>Alfredo's</hi> was to accompany his Unkle <hi>Octavio,</hi> and <hi>Porcia,</hi> who went thither in performance of a Vow <hi>Octavio</hi> had made, while Languiſhing under a Violent Diſtemper he had ſome time been recovered of. The Night before their Departure <hi>Alexander</hi> took his leave of <hi>Porcia</hi> at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow they uſed to meet at, with a real ſorrow on her part to be abſented from him, and a well expreſſed one on his, if the remembrance of <hi>Laura's</hi> Picture would allow it to be ſincere. But when ſhe had been a few days ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, neither the conſideration of diſpleaſing <hi>Carlos,</hi> nor the unaccountableneſs of this new Paſſion, could deter him from reſigning all his Fredom to the well-drawn Charms of <hi>Laura's</hi> Picture, watching all Opportunities of being in the Gallery to meditate on the Perfections appeared in that excellent Piece. One day, as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his Contemplation, a Servant brought him word that a Woman cloſe Veiled deſired to ſpeak with him, who by his Command being brought up, delivered a note into his hand, and told him ſhe muſt wait his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it; breaking off the Seal he found it contain'd a ſummons from an unknown Lady, to be directed by the Servant brought it to him, to a Window, at eight at Night, where ſhe deſired a ſhort Diſcourſe with him. He obliged the Maid to ſtay where ſhe was, untill the hour appointed, at which time going out, his concealed Guide before, after having paſſed ſeveral Streets, ſhe brought him to an Ally, whoſe narrowneſs added to the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Night, and leaving him under a little Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow opened into it from a large Houſe, ſhe took her Leave of him, telling him ſhe would let her Lady know that he attended her pleaſure. He had waited a ſhort while after the Maids departure, when he perceived the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow open, and heard one call ſoftly to him. After his firſt Complements were over, the perſon from the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ſaid: Had I not been convinced that the Generoſity
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56696:25"/>
of <hi>Alexander</hi> would not ſuffer him to diſobey the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Lady, I ſhould ſcarce have made this Trial of your obliging Diſpoſition, but ſince the repetition of many words is needleſs to one muſt beg of you what ſhe hopes you will not deny; the only inducement I can uſe to aſſure my ſelf of your compliance, is to let you know that your coming hither is to lay another Obligation on <hi>Laura,</hi> beſides that of having a reſpect more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for her Picture, neither is it I alone am engaged to a favourable eſteem for the Gallant <hi>Alexander,</hi> but my Fair Friend and Companion <hi>Cynthia</hi> has ſet ſo great a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue on your Merits, that I doubt ſhe is not far from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the worthy Maſter of them: and to acquaint you with the deſign of your being ſent for hither, it is both from her and my ſelf, (if our Intreaties can prevail) that you would be leſs Aſſiduous with <hi>Carlos</hi> in favour of your Friend <hi>Alfredo;</hi> for be confident, <hi>Cynthia's</hi> thoughts are ſo far from approving his pretentions, that if it be perſiſted in 'twill occaſion that Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and her Brother, which ſhe would moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly avoid, and be troubled your Interceſſion ſhould oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion it; wherefore it lies upon you to deter <hi>Carlos</hi> from allowing it any further progreſs, and reduce <hi>Alfredo</hi> to a reſolution of perſiſting no longer in a deſign will never prove ſucceſsful. <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo ſurprized to hear the name of <hi>Laura,</hi> and tranſported with the imagination of being ſo near her, that the pleaſing diſturbance it had put him in, would not ſuffer a paſſage to his Words whereby he might form an Anſwer to what ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, more than with broken expreſſions to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her he ſhould rejoyce in that Obedience ſhe required of him. So that giving her leiſure to recollect what ſhe intended to acquaint him with, ſhe continued her Diſcourſe, ſaying: Now Generous <hi>Alexander,</hi> that I have obeyed the Injunction <hi>Cynthia</hi> laid on me; believing you will admire to find me in her Company, and her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56696:25"/>
power, I muſt beg your patience to hear the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. <hi>Carlos</hi> has already told you my Inclination had preferred him above all others, my Quality and the place of my Birth you have learnt from him; but ſince his reſervedneſs has kept you ignorant of the occaſion brought me to <hi>Mantua,</hi> and into his Houſe, relying on your ſecreſie, you ſhall be informed of the cauſe of it from <hi>Laura</hi> her ſelf. During the time of <hi>Carlos</hi>'s abode in <hi>Rome,</hi> our Loves were grown reciprocal, when he took that Journey with you, (ſoon after your firſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) to viſit the moſt remarkable Places in <hi>Italy,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Siſter in a Convent ſhe had been bred in, until he ſhould return; I heard afterward by him, that being called home by the death of your Father, you took your Leave of one another in <hi>Florence,</hi> he to come back to <hi>Rome,</hi> while you haſted to the City we are now in; <hi>Carlos</hi> was come within a league of <hi>Rome</hi> without meeting any thing remarkable after he left you, but then he ſaw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards him a Coach and ſix Horſes, driving with an unuſual Speed, and before it came near him, turned out of the High-Road, and ſtopt at a Wood-ſide, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſtance from it; believing there was ſomething extraordinary in what he had ſeen, his Curioſity made him ride to the other ſide of the Grove, and quitting his Horſe, he made a paſſage through the Boughs till he came near the place where the Coach ſtood; from whence he ſaw there had alighted two Gentlemen, who entring the Wood made a ſtand in an open place ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near that where the thickneſs of the Buſhes had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed him, and heard one of them, with a diſturbed tone, accoſt the other. My Lord <hi>Albert,</hi> (ſaid he) I have brought you hither to let you know you have failed in that reſpect is due to our Friendſhip, ſince you could ſo much forget my adoration was placed on that Lady, as to dare purſue the ſupplanting of it, to advance your own. I confeſs my Lord Duke (replied
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56696:26"/>
the other) you was before hand with me — <hi>Laura</hi> was come thus far with her Diſcourſe, when one coming haſtily to her from within, ſhe ſtarted up, and only ſaying, farewell <hi>Alexander,</hi> till to morrow this time, when I ſhall expect you in the ſame place, She retired from the Window; and <hi>Alexander</hi> returned home ſtrangely confuſed within himſelf at ſo unthought of an adventure as he had met with. The joy of having found a real <hi>Laura,</hi> quite baniſht from his thoughts the remembrance of his once admirable <hi>Porcia,</hi> and if ſhe did at any time poſſeſs them, he made himſelf believe her Beauty had never made any firm Impreſſion in his Mind, at leſt he allowed that Change excuſable, he had not without ſome ſtruggling ſubmitted to, and forced by a Beauty much preferrable to what he forſook; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident ſhe was not Miſtreſs of leſs Charms than were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her by the Painter, but rather would have allow'd them excelling the Copy, if they ſhould appear equal to her Wit. He wiſht with a violent impatience the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the next Night, ſpending the remainder of that Night and the Day following in a ſerious contemplation of his Unfortunate, yet in ſome Conſiderations Happy Condition. What am I reduced to (would he ſay to himſelf) that I muſt either be miſerable by my own obſtinacy, or offend in the higheſt nature the beſt of Friends? ſhall I ſhun ſeeing her again, and learn to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my captivity, thereby confirming my conſtancy to <hi>Porcia,</hi> and fidelity to <hi>Carlos?</hi> No, no, 'tis no longer in my Power, nor did I ever love till I beheld the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of <hi>Laura;</hi> I never had, nor can have a Paſſion but for her; Yet ſhall I betray my Friend? yes, I muſt, I hope I have already ſupplanted him: nor can that be termed a Treaſon which Merit occaſions; alas! if I ſought; how can my Tongue be ſilent againſt the very impulſe of my ſoul; I muſt rather periſh fondly by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Laura,</hi> than let <hi>Carlos</hi> owe me a ſilent fidelity.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56696:26"/>
                  <hi>Carlos</hi> is guilty in ſo far doubting my Loyalty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her being here, but I will take him at his word, let him be delighted with the remembrance of that <hi>Laura</hi> he left at <hi>Rome,</hi> while I Triumph in the Love of <hi>Laura</hi> that is in <hi>Mantua.</hi> Fixt in this reſolution, he waited the following Evenings Approach with the impatience of one that hopes a Bleſſing, which was no ſooner come, but he made haſte to the appointed Window, and at the prefixt time found it opened by his Beloved <hi>Laura,</hi> who told him he might now be ſecure from that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption had forced her the night before to retire, which was the coming in of <hi>Carlos,</hi> who was now in Bed, and <hi>Cynthia</hi> in her own Chamber aſleep. <hi>Alexander</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from her diſcourſe of <hi>Cynthia,</hi> took occaſion high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to complain againſt the ſcrupulous humour of <hi>Carlos,</hi> for being ſo reſerved in concealing his Siſter, that all the Friendſhip between them had not made him deſerve a ſight of her: which reſtraint of his has now engaged me in ſuch a deſire of procuring it (added he,) that though only the gratifying my Curioſity is what I ſeek, yet unleſs you forbid it, it ſhall be accompliſhed, if to the endangering a breach in our Friendſhip. To aſſure you (anſwered <hi>Laura</hi>) I do not emulate the Merits of my Friend, you have permiſſion to endeavour what you mention, though on your part, the ſight of ſo many Charms may endanger the Conſtancy of the Firmeſt Lover; ſince there have been in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> thoſe who allowed her worthy the greateſt admiration: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam (replied the Amorous <hi>Alexander</hi>) although there were as commanding a power in <hi>Cynthia's</hi> Beauty, as your Friendſhip affords it, that 'tis enough to ſee her and be conquered; yet They muſt be reckoned free from that danger, who have been bleſt in ſeeing <hi>Laura,</hi> though but ſhadowed. I ſhall believe you reſolute (ſaid ſhe interrupting him) if you can behold her with indifference, whoſe Form perhaps has been the particular care of Heaven in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56696:27"/>
moulding; and before you attempt ſeeing her, imagine you may incounter one much tranſcending whatever you can imagine in <hi>Laura,</hi> who may be flattered too much in the Copy you have ſeen: No, Fair <hi>Laura,</hi> (replyed he) if you had not a ſufficient aſſurance of your own Charms, you would ſcarce have afforded thoſe praiſes to your Friends, which indifferent Beauties are ſhy of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning in anothers favour. Perhaps (ſaid ſhe) it would not be diſpleaſing to me, if <hi>Alexander</hi> were as much captivated by <hi>Cynthia's</hi> Beauty, as he pretends to be by <hi>Laura's</hi> Picture. Theſe laſt words of Hers made him ſo doubtful what might be meant by them, that not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to attempt knowing more of her meaning, he changed his Diſcourſe into a deſire that ſhe would oblige him with the Concluſion of what ſhe was the Night before interrupted in. Which ſhe ſeeming willing to do, being inminded by him where ſhe left off, continued, ſaying: After the Lords had retorted a few more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding Expreſſions on one another, they were both ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to let their Swords end the Diſpute; the Duke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaying, ſince we both pretend our love to be ſo great, that neither can relinquiſh his Hopes but with his Life, let the ſurvivor continue his, while the other's are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him. <hi>Carlos</hi> finding himſelf ſo near, believed after he ſaw them both bleed, that he might without wrong to eithers Honour, endeavour the concluſion of the Combat; and throwing himſelf between them, not without much difficulty, he got them at ſuch a diſtance from each other, that he might have time to ſpeak to them. Why, my Lords (ſaid he) ſhould the Conqueſt of a Beauty coſt the endangering two Lives ſo Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? If the Ladies pleaſure be ſtill undecided, is it not more conduceable to pretend in a way of Gallantry, whereby one may prove happy in her Eſteem, while the other will ſuffer little by the loſs of a Lady whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were not to be gained by him? I am ſatisfied
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56696:27"/>
replied Lord <hi>Albert</hi> (who knew <hi>Carlos</hi> very well) to conform to the Propoſition has been made, and refer my Fortune to the Judgement of her I Adore, with promiſe to deſiſt all future pretences, if rejected by her. The Duke at length was prevailed with, by <hi>Carlos</hi>'s Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Intreaties to do the like; ſo that having put a period to their Diſpute, they returned back to the Coach which waited at the outſide of the Wood, and took <hi>Carlos</hi> with them in it back to <hi>Rome.</hi> As they were in the Coach together, the Duke gave <hi>Carlos</hi> an account of their Love, ſaying it was placed on a Lady who was ſo nice and reſerved, that neither of them had at any time been happy in receiving a Smile from her, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Paſſion might have the incouragement of a bare hope, that they only had the equal ſatisfaction of ſeeing her in the Church ſhe uſually reſorted to, and both the day before attempting to ſpeak to her in her return, were prevented by one another, which occaſioned that quarrel he had found them engaged in; and telling them the place of her Abode and Name, he was not a little diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in himſelf to hear that it was I that had made them (though unknowingly) Enemies. That Evening <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> made me a viſit, and after having with ſatisfaction enough to him, welcomed his Return, he told me of the Adventure he had met with of the Duke and Marquiſs upon my account; and in requital to him, withal to remove any growing jealouſie he might conceive, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the troubleſom aſſiduity they uſed to conquer me, each ſtriving to outvy his Rival in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes equal to the greatneſs of their Quality, which I found in ſome Letters had been clandeſtinely conveyed to me much againſt my will. <hi>Carlos</hi> not overpleaſed that I ſhould be expoſed to the Courtſhip of two perſons ſo eminent, and who had reſolved to purſue their wiſhes with the utmoſt diligence, perſwaded me, ſince I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Parents, to be a Check to their Declaration of what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56696:28"/>
would be very prejudicial to my Credit, that I would leave the Aunt I lived with, and conſent to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his Siſter <hi>Cynthia's,</hi> and his Reaſons I thought ſo weighty, that without giving any account of the place I retired to, his Counſel was followed by me; and in very few days after, <hi>Carlos</hi> reſolving to return home with his Siſter, hearing of his Fathers death, our intimacy was grown ſo great, that being too earneſtly requeſted by her, I rather choſe to viſit <hi>Mantua</hi> than loſe her Company, thereby ſecuring my ſelf from two dangerous and potent Pretenders againſt my Honour, for I could ſcarce believe either deſigned to make a Wife of one whoſe Birth was ſo much inferiour to their own; nor would I ever venture abroad, during our ſtay in <hi>Rome,</hi> for fear of being diſcovered by them, only once I was obliged to do it with <hi>Cynthia,</hi> when ſhe went to take her Leave at the Convent ſhe had been bred up in from a Child, until her Brothers coming took her from their Innocent Society; and then I narrowly miſt being known by my vigilant Searchers. But to keep you no longer in ſuſpence, I ſhall only tell you 'tis now three weeks ſince our arrival at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and hearing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertive company uſed to viſit <hi>Carlos, Cynthia</hi> and I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring privately to hear how you men entertain one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, procured, under pretence of being loſt, a Maſter-Key belonging to <hi>Carlos,</hi> which would at any time give us entrance where we might overhear your Diſcouſe, which we did when you ſo undeſervedly applauded my Picture, and urged <hi>Carlos</hi> his beſtowing <hi>Cynthia</hi> on your Friend <hi>Alfredo,</hi> which ſhe was ſo averſe to, that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the confidence her ſelf, ſhe prevailed with me in her name to entreat you would prevent her Brothers taking any ſuch reſolution, which ſince you have promiſed, I will endeavour to bring you where <hi>Cynthia</hi> her ſelf ſhall return you the thanks are due to <hi>Alexanders</hi> generoſity; And after ſhe had perſwaded him to forget <hi>Laura</hi> for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56696:28"/>
one more worthy of his affection, ſhe made him retire, with permiſſion of viſiting her another Night. As <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was happy in the converſation of his adored <hi>Laura</hi> every Evening; though he feared her too much enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with his Friend, and that her permitting him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe her was on <hi>Cynthia's</hi> account, he pleaſed himſelf enough with being near her, though on any occaſion, hoping in time, ſhe might be brought to approve that her ſelf, ſhe ſeemed then to purſue for another; and every day his entertainment was in <hi>Carlos</hi> Chamber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her Picture. As he was one Afternoon alone in it, he heard himſelf ſoftly called, and turning about could ſee no body, but at his Feet a Note; which at firſt he thought fallen from himſelf, but opening it he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe Words,</p>
               <p>—<hi>Leoninda</hi> will expect you this Evening at the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-gate, and conduct you to a Chamber in our Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have no time to add more.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> not doubting but the aſſignation was made by <hi>Laura,</hi> wiſhed with impatience for the times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, more earneſt to behold his Charming <hi>Laura,</hi> than <hi>Carlos</hi>'s Siſter, whom he believed ſhe deſigned to ſhew him; and paſſing the day with his Friend <hi>Carlos,</hi> as ſoon as ever it was dark, he went to the Garden, where he found <hi>Leoninda</hi> ready to conduct him into the Houſe, whither being brought, ſhe left him in a dark Room, while ſhe went to give notice of his being there: the Place was a good while ſilent, till at laſt hearing a Door unlock, he advanced to meet his adored <hi>Laura;</hi> But how was he amazed to behold entring, inſtead of her, <hi>Carlos,</hi> his injured Friend, with a Light in one Hand and a drawn Sword in the other.</p>
               <p>Juſt as <hi>Ceſario</hi> was come to this part of his Relation, the Princeſs was interrupted from farther Attention, by ſeveral Perſons entring into the Preſence, in a manner ſomething unuſual; among which there was one, who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56696:29"/>
by the ſtrangeneſs of his Dreſs appeared an <hi>African,</hi> who having been very earneſt to ſpeak with the Dutcheſs, was brought in by one of the Officers, upon his pretence of having ſomething extraordinary to communicate to her, which ſhe being acquainted with, commanded him, before <hi>Ceſario</hi> proceeded in the ſtory of <hi>Alexander,</hi> to inform her what had urged him to be ſo ſolicitous of ſpeaking to her: who throwing himſelf at her feet told her that what he had to relate muſt be to her ſelf alone, unleſs abſolutely enjoyned the contrary by her: the meanneſs of his Garb, and diſorder of his Looks made thoſe who were with the Dutcheſs think it unſafe to truſt him in what he requeſted, and beſought her to let him be examined by ſome Officer who might give her an account of his buſineſs; and one being called to that purpoſe, the poor Stranger, preſſing ſo near the Dutcheſs, that he could not be overheard unleſs by <hi>Niſe</hi> who ſtood by her; Madam (ſaid he) is it with your Highneſs permiſſion that I muſt relate to the perſon appointed, what concerns my dear Lord <hi>Fredericks</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. He had no ſooner mentioned that Name, but a ſudden diſorder appeared in the afflicted Princeſs's Face, ſurprized to think that a Stranger ſhould be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what ſhe thought a Secret to the whole world: and finding her diſturbance increaſe by her endeavours to ſuppreſs it, ſhe roſe haſtily up, and taking <hi>Niſe</hi> by the Arm to ſupport her, retired to her Cloſet, leaving all the company amazed at her departure. She had not been long withdrawn, when a Lady came from her to bring in the poor Stranger, who as ſoon as he ſaw none with her but <hi>Niſe,</hi> the reſt having withdrawn to the further end of the Room, kneeling down at a little diſtance, and with tears in his eyes; ſaid to her, Madam, it has pleaſed Providence at laſt to bring me where I can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the injunction of my unhappy Lord; who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me if he ended his days in the captivity we were in,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56696:29"/>
that if ever I ſhould ſee <hi>Italy,</hi> I ſhould acquaint your Highneſs with thoſe misfortunes happened to him after his being believed dead, and thrown into the adjacent River. What, ſaid the Dutcheſs interrupting him, was it not <hi>Frederick</hi> who was murdered and carried away by the Streams! Yes Madam (ſaid he) it was my Dear Maſter received all thoſe wounds were intended him; but at that time Heaven was pleaſed to ſpare his Life, though, as it has proved ſince, only to let him go with more misfortunes to his Grave. That joy which the Dutcheſs began to receive at the mention of his being alive, was ſoon turned to her wonted affliction at the Strangers laſt words; but a little recovering her ſelf, and earneſt to know the particulars of <hi>Frederick's</hi> ſecond death, as ſhe termed it, ſhe deſired him to give her an account of what ſhe was ignorant of concerning that unhappy man.</p>

               <p>The Dutcheſs hearing their Names, deſired him to omit nothing which might concern a perſon ſo much eſteemed by her, as <hi>Roſelinda;</hi> and <hi>Fredericks</hi> Loyal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant perceiving ſhe expected to know what he had to inform her of, began his ſad ſtory.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56696:30"/>
I did not overtake my Maſter till he had been ſome time here in <hi>Mantua,</hi> where I was overjoyed to find him in ſo high Favour with the Duke; and after a few days, (congratulating his happineſs in being deſigned the Husband of <hi>Roſelinda</hi>) he was pleaſed out of a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had of my ſecreſie, to tell me how little agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that match was to him. I need not repeat to your Highneſs any thing which paſt in <hi>Mantua</hi> till the fatal Night was deſigned for his deſtruction, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Palace, a little diſtance from whence I wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his return, a ſudden noiſe of Swords made me retire where I might be leſs taken notice of, without imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him concerned in that quarrel: till a while after believing by their ſilence, all was over, I drew near enough to hear one of the Guards ſay, although he be not wounded, his falling into the River muſt be his death; another replying, I have found his Sword, which by as much as I can diſcern in the dark, is rich enough to be owned by a Perſon of Quality; growing a little ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious by their words, and frighted at their naming a man thrown into the River, I adventured to ask them what the diſturbance was I had heard a little before; which one of them telling me, and ſhewing me the Sword, I was half dead at the knowledge that it was my Dear Maſters; and crying out 'tis Lord <hi>Fredericks,</hi> Lord <hi>Frederick</hi> is ſlain, I ran to that part of the River where they told me he was thrown in, but being able to perceive nothing, I followed the Current all Night, making the Banks eccho to my Grief for the loſs of him, and the beſt part of the next day was ſpent in the ſame manner, when towards Evening falling in among ſome Huts the Fiſhermen had ſet up upon the Banks, one of them hearing what I was in ſearch of, told me, that being moſt of the Night Fiſhing upon the River, he had diſcerned ſomething carried down by the Stream come very near his Boat, and making towards it, took up a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56696:31"/>
man in a very rich Garb almoſt dead, which he thought had been occaſioned by his being tired with Swimming; but bringing him aſhore to his Hut, he found him all over bloody, and as he believed then quite dead: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the charitable man, willing to give him what aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he could, firſt rolling his body on a Tub, which brought a great quantity of Water from him, and then laying him wrapt in dry Woollen near a Fire, his heat began to return, and at length he opened his Eyes, though without any ſenſe or knowledge of what was done to him; and removing him thence to a Bed, they bound up his wounds as well as they could, till a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon could be brought from the next Town, which the careful Hoſt went for, but at his return, he met ſome of his Comrades in a great Fright, ſaying the Corſairs of <hi>Tunis</hi> had landed and carried off with them ſeveral of their Companions Slaves, whom they had ſurprized in their Huts; that as ſoon as their fear would give them leave, returning to their Huts, he miſt his wounded Gueſs, whom he imagined they had taken away in that condition, incouraged by the rich Cloaths lay by him, believing if he lived, ſuch a booty would afford a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to requite the pains of curing him; but he was confident the condition he had left him in, would not bear a remove without the loſs of his life, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him certainly dead. This ſecond misfortune put me quite beyond my conſideration of reaſon, and I ſtayed that Night with my Maſters Hoſt, conſuming it in the conſideration of what courſe I ſhould take to know what was become of him, whom I could not but hope to be ſtill alive, ſince he had eſcaped ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly from the River. I reſolved to viſit <hi>Tunis,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I expoſed my ſelf to a certain ſlavery, which in a few days I performed; having met with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship was bound thither to Trade, I embarqued my ſelf, and in leſs than a month after my Maſters being carried
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56696:31"/>
away, I was landed in that conſiderable City of <hi>Affrick.</hi> It had been my Fathers miſchance, when young, to be taken and kept ſix years a ſlave in <hi>Tripoli,</hi> during which time he had perfectly learnt the <hi>Arabick</hi> Language, and for a diverſion had taught me ſo much of it, that I could diſcourſe indifferently well in it, and it ſtood me ſo much in ſtead, that cloathing my ſelf in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Garb, I was credited to be what I pretended my ſelf, a <hi>Moor</hi> of <hi>Tetuan,</hi> taken a ſlave by the Chriſtians ſo young, that I had almoſt forgot my own Language, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by my hard labour got enough to procure my ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, I was landed there in order to return to my own Country. So that being lookt on as an abſolute <hi>Moor,</hi> I had as much opportunity as I could wiſh to inquire after my dear Maſter, though a great while without any effect; till one day hearing ſome Slaves talk of their Captivity, and inquiring from what part they had been taken, one of them told me he was a <hi>Mantuan,</hi> brought over much about the time I knew my Maſter was loſt; and examining him more particularly of what other Slaves were taken with him, I learnt, not without a tranſport of joy, that he came thither in the ſame Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with my Maſter, that by the <hi>Moors</hi> care of his wounds, both during their Voyage and a-ſhore, he had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered, and ſince was bought by the King of <hi>Tunis</hi> for a vaſt price: Upon this intelligence I was ſo continually about the Seraglio, that at laſt I diſcovered my dear Maſter in a Dreſs much different to what I was wont to behold him; he was pleaſed to tell me my preſence was not a little welcome to him, though he lookt ſhyly on me, fearing by my wearing a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, I had been turned Renegado; till giving him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all I had done, his goodneſs but too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged my love to him. For the firſt time we durſt not be too long together, leſt my Diſguiſe ſhould grow ſuſpected; and afterwards when we met, our Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56696:32"/>
was how poſſibly to procure his enlargement from a Maſter never admitted a ranſom for his Slaves: ſo that all our hopes muſt depend on the Kings being procured to give him to ſome Courtier who would be willing to ſee him exchanged for a conſiderable ſum of money. During the time we were taken up with theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, there happen'd an occaſion which I was willing to lay hold of, as what might much conduce to my Lords enlargement. A Noble man of <hi>Tunis,</hi> called <hi>Mahomad Alli,</hi> having a young Son whom he deſired to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Muſick, and hearing I had learnt a profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in that uſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> during my Captivity, ſent for me, making great offers of requital if I would take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me the teaching of his Son, which I willingly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in a few weeks gained the Fathers heart by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement his Son had made in the Science I was thought a Maſter of. And being of himſelf a man more deſirous of knowledge than the generality of his Country men are, he took a great delight in hearing me relate the Manners and Cuſtoms of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> ſo that at laſt I was grown ſo much in his favour as to be intruſted with the management of his Affairs, and ordering his Houſe in the City, when he went to divertiſe himſelf at a Seat he had ſome miles out of Town, where he uſed often to be, as I learnt, drawn thither by the love of a fair Chriſtian Slave had been preſented him; and finding his good opinion of me ſo great, that he expreſt a willingneſs to do me any conſiderable kindneſs I could beg of him: One day when he was much delighted to hear me play on the Harp, I told him among the Kings Slaves I had met with a young man whom I knew in <hi>Italy,</hi> and whoſe Friends had been ſo particularly kind in conducing to my deliverance from a long Captivity, that the only thing I would beſeech of him was, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to get that Slave out of the Kings hands, which he might beg for, not without hopes of ſucceſs, and give
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56696:32"/>
me leave as a grateful requital to him and his Friends to ſet him at liberty; as ſoon as he heard what I deſired of him, he blamed my modeſty in asking ſo ſmall a Boon, and promiſed that very day to procure what I ſought, not doubting to ſpeed in it. At the time he went to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> to procure my Lords liberty, I went to acquaint him the good news of a freedom he might ſoon expect: but all our joy was diſſipated at <hi>Mahomads</hi> return, who told me, that although my requeſt was ſmall, yet at that time impoſſible to be granted, for the King having news of a Rebellion in the fartheſt part of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which being ſlighted at firſt, had given the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels time to carry all before them; ſo that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to go in perſon with an Army againſt them, all his Slaves were appointed for the journey, and that he himſelf being commanded to attend the King in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, reſolved to intruſt the Government and Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Family to my care until his return. If I was grieved at the certain prolongation of my Maſters capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that concern was doubly aggravated at the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of being ſeparated from him ſo long a time as that was like to be, if he ſhould ever return. I uſed all the arguments I could to perſwade <hi>Mahomad</hi> I might accompany him, but in concluſion it was almoſt by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced licence that I went, having declared, that if he thought me unworthy to be near him where he might be expoſed to continual dangers, as ſoon as ever he was departed to the Army, I would return to my Native Country and Friends in <hi>Tetuan.</hi> A few days after the King began his journey, finding at the Randezvous he had appointed, a compleat Army of thirty five thouſand men, all well appointed, beſides the uſual attendants on a Camp; he proceeded with ſhort journeys not to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſe his men before they came up with the enemy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard by thoſe he had ſent out that they ſeemed to expect him, and it was believed would ſtand a Battel.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56696:33"/>
I ſhould paſs over what concerns the Wars of <hi>Tunis,</hi> without troubling your Highneſs to hear any thing of them, but that my dear Maſter made a conſiderable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in that War; during our march I had all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity I could deſire of ſeeing and diſcourſing with him; his reſolutions were to attempt the doing ſome remarkable action which might incite the King to give him his liberty as a reward of it, and by his order I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with my kind Patron <hi>Mahomad,</hi> that he ſhould be allowed Arms when he came to the Battel, aſſuring him they would not be imployed to the Kings diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. We began after a months ſlow march to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſo near the enemy, that our Outguards had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Skirmiſhes; and we found their Army very ſtrongly encampt, having a great River on one ſide, and a large Wood covering the other: the King ſetting down about a League from them, after a Nights refreſhment of his men, drew up his whole Army in Battalia, and ſo marcht till we faced the Enemy, believing they would lye cloſe within their Intrenchments, but <hi>Albazin</hi> the famous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel who commanded them, was as forward and earneſt to decide all by a Battel as the King could be: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore half the Morning was ſpent, both Armys began to draw ſo near in a large Plain before <hi>Albazins</hi> Camp, that the Archers could no longer be hindred from begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fight, but receiving that word of command they were impatient for, a moſt bloody and obſtinate fight commenced, which was not decided without the loſs of many thouſand lives. <hi>Albazins</hi> Army conſiſted of much an equal number with the Kings, but he had the advantage of at leaſt eight thouſand Horſe, though fewer in Foot. The King behaved himſelf like a wiſe General and bold Souldier, charging where his men were moſt preſt upon, but not being ſeconded by them with a like courage, his ſucceſs not only grew doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but the Enemy making a freſh charge with a ſtrong
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56696:33"/>
body of Horſe he kept in reſerve from the beginning of the Battel; his Right Wing was forced to give ground, having the misfortune to behold his Left in a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, the Main Body only ſtanding obſtinately to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged in a cloſe fight where all other Arms but their Swords were grown uſeleſs. <hi>Mahomad</hi> fighting near the King, I kept as cloſe to my Maſter, who by my Patrons procurement was allowed a Horſe, and to enter the Battel, where his great Actions were for ſome time obſcured in the Croud he fought amongſt; but upon <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazins</hi> freſh Charge, when our Horſe began to give ground, he preſt forward to the Front, and was got cloſe up to the King, when he perceived him ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Enemies Horſe which <hi>Albazin</hi> led in Perſon; the Kings party made ſo weak a reſiſtance, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready feared himſelf a Priſoner to his rebellious Vaſſal; and my Maſter believing then was his time to dye glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or merit his freedom, turning about to me, ſaid, Now <hi>Julian</hi> believe I fight to cut my ſelf a paſſage into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I fight in hopes of ſeeing <hi>Diana</hi> again, and am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of Victory in her Name. Ending thoſe words he clapt Spurs to his Horſe, having a ſtrong Javelin in his Hand, and preſſing cloſe to the King; Sir, ſaid he, you muſt ſtill Conquer, Heaven cannot be propitious long to a Rebel, againſt a lawful Prince. As he uttered theſe words, a Horſeman of the Enemy, whoſe Garb made him remarkable, had forced a way ſo near the King with a party which followed him, that he was juſt ſeizing his Bridle, having called to him to yield, when my Maſter clapt in between them, and thruſt his Launce quite through his body, the King having the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeeing his Enemy tumble from his Horſe dead at his Feet; which action ſtruck ſuch a terror to his Foes, and gave ſuch new life to our fainting men, ſeeing that blow ſeconded by two or three more which proved as fatal to thoſe came in his reach, that as the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56696:34"/>
to take up from their eagerneſs of Victory, and the other rallied again, not only making good their ground, but preſt after their Prince, who with my Maſter by his ſide began to recover freſh hopes of retrieving the Battel on that part. But if the face of Victory ſeemed to change where we were, it was much otherwiſe in other places; for one acquainted the King that his Left Wing was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt totally routed, and the main body ſhrinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Enemies force, was likely ſoon to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Companions. This ſad intelligence drove him quite into deſpair, making him cry out, what, what can we do more, but ſave our ſelves by flight! <hi>Conquer, Conquer,</hi> ſaid my Maſter; haſt where your preſence may reanimate your men, and be aſſured of Victory here. The King took his counſel, only ſaying as he drew off, Heaven preſerve the life of my <hi>valiant Slave,</hi> and I ſhall not doubt of Victory. The King had ſcarce left us when <hi>Albazin,</hi> angry to find ſuch a ſtop put to his proceedings, as my Maſter had given them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced before the reſt of his men, and coming near my Maſter; <hi>Slave,</hi> ſaid he, ſince thy Courage is ſo great, be honoured in receiving thy death from <hi>Albazins</hi> hand; my Maſter replied not a word to him, but receiving the ſtrong charge of his Launce upon a little Target he had on his left Arm, returned him ſuch a thruſt with his, as had almoſt thrown him quite out of his Saddle; and turning his Horſe ſhort upon his Enemies Crupper, made him feel the weight of his Scimitar before he had well recovered the ſhock of his Spear. <hi>Albazin</hi> was a man of extraordinary courage, and being quite Tranſported to meet ſuch oppoſition from a Slave, flew at him with his Scimitar, deſigning his next blow ſhould decide the controverſie; but being intercepted by my Maſters Shield, he only received a ſlight wound in his Arm, and requited it with a larger in <hi>Albazins</hi> Shoulder; while the Warriers were engaged in a ſingle combate, all the

Souldiers on both ſides forbore Fighting, to be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of what the Event of it would be; each ſide conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing their Fortune to depend on the Succeſs of their Champion; and after a ſharp Diſpute, both covered with Blood, and raiſed to the higheſt tranſports of Fury by the reſiſtance they met with, weary of further delay, they cloſed, and grappled one another on Horſ-back, each ſtriving to pull his Adverſary from his Saddle, and at once ſpurring their Horſes, both came to the Ground to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but my Maſter happily falling uppermoſt, before <hi>Albazin</hi> could recover himſelf from the diſorder of a Fall with ſuch a weight upon him, my Maſter drawing a ſhort Puniard from his Side, ſtabb'd him to the Heart, and Leaping upon his Feet, as a Trophy of his Victory, he pulled <hi>Albazins</hi> Green Turbat from his Head and clapped it on his own; that Colour being worn by the Rebel, as a Note of the Sanctity he pretended to, having at firſt by a Religious Cheat, reduced all thoſe who were of his Party from their Loyalty.

preſſing upon the King to defend themſelves againſt the impetuoſity of a freſh Charge; but the Shouts of our Men crying out, <hi>The Rebel Albazin is dead,</hi> and an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of ours, having after my Maſter left the Place where he fell, cut off his Head and fixt it on the point of a Launce, brought it in ſight of thoſe were ſtill Fighting; which Spectacle was ſo amazing to them, that now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate either of ſucceſs or ſafety, they were quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſame condition their Left-wing was in; and thoſe of their Right, which had gained advantage enough before, endeavoured to ſave themſelves by a haſty flight. There fell on the Kings Side, above eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, and moſt of the Officers who fought near the King, had loſt their Lives to ſecure his, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned my Maſters having the ſole leading of thoſe with whom he recovered a loſt Battel; the Enemy left dead on the place near thirty thouſand Men, the King putting all to the Sword after they had thrown down their Arms. As ſoon as my Maſter came where the King was alighting from his Horſe, as he would have knelt down, he took him in his Arms, calling him his deliverer and preſerver both of his Crown and Life, nor was there a Souldier in the Army, but attributed their Victory to my Maſters Courage. It will not be to my purpoſe to trouble your Highneſs with any other circumſtances paſt there, more than that all was reduced again to the Kings obedience; and after four months abſence we arrived ſafe again at <hi>Tunis:</hi> my Maſter being recovered of his wounds, and grown in ſuch eſteem with the King, that he was by all termed the <hi>favourite-Slave.</hi> One thing I had like to have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that my friend <hi>Mahomad</hi> who held a conſiderable Charge in the Army, was at the beginning of the Fight dangerouſly wounded and carried out of the Field; but afterwards he recovered, having been during his illneſs, ſo carefully attended by me, that at our coming back to

                  <hi>Tunis,</hi> he uſed me with much greater kindneſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; But a few days after, a ſad misfortune which befell my Maſter, turned all our tranquility into grief: The King having ſeen the happy effects of his Valour, and keeping him continually near him, was grown ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his Converſation, that deſirous to add Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to thoſe he had beſtowed, and for the future to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Maſter from ever urging him again to reſtore him to his Liberty, ſet very earneſtly upon him, to perſwade the alteration of his Religion; thereby putting himſelf into a condition to be the Kings Son-in-Law, he having aſſured him, he deſired no other Husband for his only Daughter. You may judg, Madam, how much he was ſurprized at ſo ſtrange a Propoſal; finding that as his own reſolutions were ſufficiently fixt, ſo the denial would much diſturb the King: And his abſolute refuſal, though with modeſty and acknowledgment enough, was ſo far from inducing the King to deſiſt, that he not only preſt it more and more every day, but ſet the <hi>Mufti</hi> upon him, to endeavour the bringing him to their Belief, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing a vaſt reward to him that ſhould prove ſuccesfull in it: and when all their Arguments and promiſes could avail nothing, one of them found a way which had near ruined my Maſter; for the King growing at laſt almoſt angry, to be refuſed that by a Slave, which he thought deſerved the Prayers of Princes to obtain, was ſatisfied with what one of the Prieſts told him, that <hi>Frederick</hi> when he had ſlain <hi>Albazin,</hi> put on his green Turbat, which colour being ſacred to their Prophet, the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who is bold to prophane it by the wearing, ought by their Laws, either to change his Religion or expiate with his Blood the offence. The King by their means, though with ſome reluctance, was perſwaded to attempt him in that matter, aſſured he would rather live the Son of a King, and Husband to a beautifull Lady, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Life for the ſake of Religion: So that one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

as he entred the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> a Guard ſeized him, and carried him away Priſoner to a private part of it, where the <hi>Mufti</hi> made him the Propoſal either of Life or Death, which laſt, he firmly demanding, rather than his Belief ſhould be ſo much as queſtioned; they ſo incenſed the King againſt him by thoſe reproaches he gave their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> that at laſt his Life became in a great deal of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and although the Execution was deferred, in hopes he might recant, yet he was made a cloſe Priſoner, with the threat of never being releaſt but on the tearms were made him. He continued a Priſoner for ſeveral months, without my being able to ſee or ſend to him; having learn'd from <hi>Mahomad</hi> the condition he was in, who very much blamed the King's ingratitude, having nothing to alledg for his excuſe, but that great influence the <hi>Mufti</hi> had over him, whom he knew to be violent in what concerns any matter of their Sect. While my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter remained in Priſon, I was grown ſo melancholy, that <hi>Mahomad,</hi> who expreſt much trouble for it, took me along with him to his Country-houſe to give me ſome diverſion; telling me he had an <hi>Italian</hi> Slave whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation he believed I ſhould be much delighted with, and as the higheſt token of his favour, promiſed me a ſight of his fair, but coy Miſtriſs; on the way he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me with his love of her, letting me know, that a Ship he ſent out at his own charge, took her among ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Captives on the Coaſt of <hi>Florence;</hi> and with her his <hi>Italian,</hi> who was brought to him deſperately wounded, having reſiſted while he had ſtrength to do it, thoſe who aſſaulted him: that he kept his fair Slave there leaſt the noiſe of her Beauty might by the Mariners diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it, come to the Kings Ear, and he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her; purpoſing by having her concealed where no body knew of her, to tell the King, if he ſhould ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after her, that ſhe had been ranſomed, reſolving rather to part with his Life than Love, although her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy

was ſuch, that he had never been able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, not having power to uſe force if ſhe were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly any other way to be won. As ſoon as we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted at his Houſe, where his Servants were ready to receive him, I could ſcarce credit my Eyes, when I knew the <hi>Italian</hi> Slave he talked of, to be <hi>Aſtolfo; Mahomad</hi> left me with him, and haſted himſelf to viſit his fair Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, (for ſo he always termed her.) <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> had ſeen me before in <hi>Italy,</hi> but the Turkiſh habit I was in, kept me from being known to him, till taking him aſide from the other Slaves, I told him who I was, and how I came to be in that dreſs; he was much rejoyced to ſee me, but more afflicted at the knowledg of my Maſters misfortunes. He told me how he came to fall into the Moors hands, that having embarqued on a Veſſel bound for <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> when he thought himſelf ſafe, being got out of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s reach, they were ſet upon by Pirates, when after the death of half their Men, and himſelf much wounded, they were Boarded and taken; that the Moors at the Prayers of <hi>Roſelinda,</hi> whoſe Beauty they admired, dreſſed his wounds, and arriving at <hi>Tunis,</hi> delivered them to <hi>Mahomad;</hi> who falling in love with his Wife, (for he had married <hi>Roſelinda</hi> in the Ship before they were taken) had kept them there in the Country ſince their firſt arrival, not knowing that he was her Husband, pretending he conducted her to Marry his Brother in <hi>Florence</hi> when they met his Ship: and he confirmed to me what <hi>Mahomad</hi> had ſaid, that he was both very kind to him, and uſed <hi>Roſelinda</hi> with much Reſpect. My Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron was as good as his word, in ſhewing me the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of his Liberty, whoſe Beauty was not at all diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince I ſaw her in <hi>Mantua,</hi> during my ſtay there. <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> and I had often conſultations how to procure their Liberty; which was impoſſible to be attained any way, but by a private eſcape, and no hopes of doing that, while <hi>Mahomad</hi> kept them in the Country; ſo that one day diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing

Charge, till the King ſhould remove them. My Maſter told me there, all that had happened to him ſince his being Confined; and that the King not being able to reſolve the Death of one he loved ſo well, nor perceiving a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of reducing him to what he wiſhed, being in earneſt ſolicited by the <hi>Mufti</hi> to take away his Life, had him ſelf privately viſited him, and bringing him out of the Priſon, took his leave of him, bidding him go where he would, and telling him he muſt accuſe his own Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy that hindered him from being as great as himſelf. He told me he had newly left the King when I met him, and was reſolved with the firſt opportunity to viſit <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and throw himſelf at your Feet; withal, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of learning if poſſible, from whoſe hands he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thoſe wounds had occaſioned all his future Miſery. I told him of <hi>Hamets</hi> Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> and of <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> and <hi>Roſelinda</hi> being in his power, withall that he had, earneſtly deſired me to accompany him in that Journey, which my Maſter was ſo much pleaſed with, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to look him out and accept of it, and that he would paſs as my Slave, till our Arrival in <hi>Spain;</hi> which he might the better do, having never been ſeen by <hi>Hamet,</hi> who was newly come from a Government he had been ſome years in, and my Maſter had been little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted among the Mariners.

But we were all drove to the higheſt Conſternation of ill, when <hi>Roſelinda</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Husband, by a Note ſhe got conveighed to him, that <hi>Hamet</hi> no longer brooking her Denials, had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, if within two days, ſhe did not reſolve to comply with his Deſires, he would at the end of them, ſatisfie his Love by Force. <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> when <hi>Hamet</hi> was gone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Governor a Viſit, ſlipt out, and finding me acquainted me with it; telling me withal, that if in the Night there were any poſſibility of getting out of the City, he could from a Window lookt into the Garden of the Houſe, let down himſelf, his Wife and <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;</hi> and ſo from the Garden, could eaſily get out into the Street; having won an Eunuch of <hi>Hamets,</hi> who had the Charge of his Houſe, to fly with them, upon a deſire he had of becoming a Chriſtian.

The City of <hi>Antiquera</hi> was at that time in the Power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being but ſeven Leagues from the Place where we were; ſo that if we could get forth untaken notice of, having once entred the Mountains, the diſcovery of us (if purſued) would be difficult, but how to find the way, created us moſt trouble, all being Strangers in that Country; to which <hi>Aſtolfo</hi> anſwered, that <hi>Hamet</hi> having bought a Spaniſh Slave, ſince his Arrival, they might eaſily take him with them, who would doubtleſs ſerve as a Guide.

I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer, for the Night following, ſaying I would bring a Friend or two with me, ſo we parted till the next day; in the mean time, having given notice to the reſt to be ready two hours within Night. I would not be ſeen by the young Moor till toward the Evening, when I believed he would expect me ready to go; and then finding him at his Gate waiting only my coming to be gone, I told him an unlookt-for buſineſs would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly detain me till ſome time within Night, but if he would order the Gate to be opened for me and my Friends, we would certainly be with him long before Morning; he was very deſirous of ſtaying for me, but I pretending to accept no ſuch Compliment, perſwaded him to ſet forward, firſt commanding the Guard to let me, and who ever came with me, through at any time of the Night. After he was gone, I waited at my Lodging till the time drew near, for my Maſter and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies coming forth, and then finding the Back-door of the Garden to <hi>Hamets</hi> Houſe, at the time I had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, came forth my Maſter, <hi>Aſtolfo, Roſelinda,</hi> the Eunuch, and the Slave, who had with Joy undertaken to be our Guide. As ſoon as I came to the Gate, according to the

Order had been given, they let us all forth without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Queſtion; and taking the Way our Guide dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, a little after Midnight we reached the Mountains; as we were on the way, the Eunuch told us, that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> coming early home, and viſiting <hi>Roſelinda,</hi> ſtayed no longer, than to tell her, that the following Night ſhe muſt either by force, or freely yield, and ſo leaving her went to Bed, whom he lockt in and then brought forth all his Companions to me, whoſe Deſign of flying to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians he much wondred at, till acquainted with my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. All that night we travelled without meeting any Body, having reached about three Leagues, the ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo Rocky, that <hi>Roſelinda</hi> could ſcarce climb the Hills with all the Aſſiſtance we afforded her; and though we had got the advantage of the Suns Light, yet our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney all day was as tedious, being perſwaded by our Guide to leave the Road for fear of a purſuit; ſo that what with our going about, and making a way thorow the Sedge of the Mountains, it was within an hour of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet when we came to the utmoſt of the Hills, from whence we could diſcern a ſpacious Plain, and a League from the Foot of the Mountain, on a riſing Ground, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an City, grown famous by holding out ſo long againſt the Moors, that the Grandchildren of thoſe who firſt ſhut up the Gates, at that time maintained the Walls againſt their Enemies, having been beſieged and blocked up near ſeventy years. We made what poſſible haſt we could down into the Plain, hoping before Night to enter our City of Refuge; but the difficulty of deſcending the crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Cliffs where there was no Path, took us up ſo much time that it was quite dark when we recovered the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, of thoſe aſperous Mountains, and though we were got into a High-way which our Guide told us, Lead to the City, yet fearing to encounter any Party of Moors, who uſed to be abroad in the Night, we left the Tract, and by the direction of our Spaniſh Captive, going almoſt

half a mile within the Plain, we came to the Foot of a large and ſteep Rock, which roſe in the middle of the Valley, being to be got up but on one ſide, the other making a very high Precipice. At the bottom of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Rock we thought it convenient to Repoſe our ſelves as in a place of ſecurity, till the days approach, when our <hi>Spaniard</hi> told us there would be no hazard of meeting any Enemies, the Chriſtians uſing to be abroad every Morning, to ſcour the Coaſt of thoſe Parties of Moors, who many times by the Nights ſhelter, have adventured under their very Walls, either to Alarm them, or take up any they could find ſtragling without their Lines. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericks</hi> loyal ſervant coming to this part of his Relation, was interrupted by a crowd of Sighs forced a paſſage from his Breaſt; but a little ſuppreſſing them, and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tears from his Eyes, I wiſh Madam (continued he) I might here conclude my Story, ſince what remains to acquaint you with, I am confident will occaſion no leſs trouble to you, than pitty for thoſe unfortunate people whoſe Adventures you have heard.</p>
               <p>The fair Dutcheſs could not ſuppreſs her foreboding ſorrow, to find how unwilling he was to let her know any more; but ſtriving with her ſelf, and in a manner expecting the worſt, She deſired he would leave nothing untold which concerned any of that miſerable Company; and leaning on <hi>Niſe,</hi> with a Handkerchief wet with Tears before her Eyes, ſhe liſtened to the concluſion of his Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Since you muſt not be diſobeyed (ſaid the ſorrowful <hi>Roman</hi>) I am to acquaint your Highneſs, that we ſpent moſt part of the Night with ſatisfaction enough in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating our paſt Adventures, joyful that in a few hours we hoped to find our ſelves in a place of ſafety, and the firſt dawn of the Morning was welcomed by us all; at which time in a Road not far from the Rock, we heard the trampling of Horſes, and ſoon after, diſcovered a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56696:40"/>
as we gueſſed, coming from the City; Our Guide told us there was no doubt to be made, but they were Chriſtians come abroad to ſcoure the Valley, this being juſt their time of going out; and againſt the conſent of us all, and before we were aware, he called out to them, who to our Aſtoniſhment anſwered in <hi>Arabick,</hi> They are Chriſtians! Seize them, ſays a Moor, that at leaſt I may have ſomething to wreck my Revenge on; and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, they advanced towards us. Immediately, finding the Danger we had fallen into, by the unhappy <hi>Spaniards</hi> haſty ſpeaking, he thought to make ſome part of amends by telling us, that if we could climb to the top of the Rock, our little Party would be ſufficient to defend it againſt an Army for ſome time, and that after it was Day, the Moors would not venture to ſtay ſo near the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; we followed his Advice with a Diligence equal to our threatned danger; and were aſcended to a good height by that time our Enemies were got to that part of it we had quitted. But oh Heavens!

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56696:40"/>
my Valiant Lord, with the two firſt Stones went from his hand, depriving two of our Enemies of their Lives. This ſtrange and unequal Combat laſted above an hour, in which time, <hi>Hamets</hi> Men were reduced to half their number; but on our ſide, the Eunuch and our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Guide were both ſlain by the Arrows were ſhot at us, and not one but had received a wound, or more.

He ran to her with as much ſpeed as his weakneſs would permit; and taking her in his Arms, I could hear him faintly ſay, farewell my moſt unfortunate Wife, ſince I cannot live for you, at leaſt give me the ſatisfaction of dying in your Arms; to which ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;

One of thoſe aſſiſted near me was about ſatisfying my requeſt, when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the Governours coming in to make me a Viſit; and being informed who he was, I would have raiſed my ſelf in the Bed to receive him, when he ſtept to the ſide of it, and hindred me, ſaying I was not in

a Condition to uſe Ceremony, and that he had deferred till then coming to ſee, that I might not be diſturbed of that Repoſe was ſo neceſſary for me; but that being told by the Chyrurgeons, I might with ſafety be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with, he was come to give me an account how I fell into his hands; and ſetting down on a Chair by the Bed ſide he let me know, that himſelf going out with a Party the Morning of our Combate, at a good diſtance from the Rock he ſaw people on the top of it; but believing them ſome of the Garriſon were got up thither to deſcry if the Country were free from thoſe who almoſt every Night infeſted it, he kept on his way at an eaſie pace, when one of his Company told him, he could diſcover naked Swords in their Hands on the Rock, and gueſſed by their moving about, that it was a fight they were ingaged in; whereupon mending his pace, he came to the bottom of the Hill, juſt as a Man and Woman, arm in arm, had thrown themſelves from the top, and were daſhed in pieces almoſt hard by where he ſtood, and that while he was ſurveying the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, his men had perceived ſome <hi>Moors</hi> holding a good number of Horſes on the other ſide of the Rock, and riding round, they ſaw thoſe we had left alive coming down, who finding themſelves diſcovered would have retreated up the Hill again, but were overtaken by his men, and incouraged by one who ſeemed their Maſter, ſuffered themſelves all to be cut in pieces rather than he ſhould be taken, himſelf ending his life in the ſame place amongſt his men. He added to me, that having diſpatched the <hi>Moors,</hi> he climbed up to the top of the Rock, to take a view of what had been done there, where he found a great many dead <hi>Moors</hi> whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be thrown into an adjacent Pit; but that upon ſearch of the bodies, finding about two or three of us, Medals, which declared our profeſſion to be Enemies of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Sect; he ordered our bodies to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

to the City, that we might receive the rites of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; but being laid on a Table, I had been perceived to ſtir, ſo that they carried me to a Bed, and after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral applications, brought me out of the ſwound, the want of blood had thrown me into; but that the reſt had been interred together in the principal Church. This certainty of my dear Maſters death, reduced me into as ill a condition as I had been found in on the Rock, ſo that it was the next Morning before I could be brought to my ſenſes again, when I would have torn the Plaiſters from my Wounds to follow my loſt Lord; but the good Governour being in the Room, uſed ſo many perſwaſions to me, that at laſt I was ſatisfied to wait the pleaſure of Heaven, either in my death or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; which in a month after proved the latter, ſo that I was become able to walk abroad; And would have taken my leave of my Noble Hoſt in order to return hither, reſolving afterwards to retire into my own Country, that I might ſpend the reſt of my days in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing, without interruption, the loſs of my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Maſter: but the Generous Governour not only refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let me ſtir, till I had recovered ſome more ſtrength, but withal, after he had heard from me the quality and misfortunes of thoſe he had interred, would have me ſtay to ſee their Obſequies celebrated in a more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did manner than what before had been done; ſo that the week following I was conducted to the great Church, where a very fair Monument was ſet up, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription relating the manner of their deaths; were to lye in a Vault under it, and towards the bottom was engraven on a fair Marble, theſe words, <hi>Let the White Rock in the midſt of the Vale of</hi> Antiquera, <hi>for ever after be called the Lovers Rock.</hi> After the Ceremonies ended, having burnt ſeveral Perfumes to hinder the ill ſmell of thoſe had been ſo long dead; the bodys were taken up, and brought through the Church to be depoſited in the

As ſoon as I ſaw them bringing towards me, I went forward, deſiring their faces might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that I might once more behold that of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but a freſh diſturbance ſeized me when I beheld thoſe of <hi>Roſelinda, Aſtolfo</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Slave, which were all that had been brought from the Rock, as the Governour aſſured me, but my Dear Maſter was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo that concluding he had been left among the <hi>Moors</hi> in the Pit on the top of the Rock, I not only procured a Guard from the Governour to go thither in ſearch of him, but he would accompany me himſelf to that fatal place. As ſoon as we came there he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bodies to be dragged out, but could find none but ſuch as we knew to be <hi>Moors,</hi> both by their Cloaths, and having no Hair on their Heads: among the reſt I found the wretched Eunuchs body, but not the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any thing like my Maſters: we ſearched eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Corner both of the Rock and adjacent Fields; but not being able to make any diſcovery, I returned back with the Governour, though full of perplexity, yet not without ſome faint hopes, that Heaven might by ſome Miracle have preſerved ſo conſiderable a Life.</p>
               <p>The fair Dutcheſs who had liſtned to his Story more dead than alive, began a little to recover herſelf, at this part of his Relation, which he continued telling her, that after ſome few days longer abode at <hi>Antiquera,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Governour with his deſign, he betook himſelf to his former diſguiſe of a <hi>Moors</hi> Habit, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſearch all the Country under their juriſdiction, if poſſible, to learn ſomething of what was become of his Maſter; but (continued he) after I had ſpent much time in a fruitleſs inquiry, concluding that Great Man cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly loſt, and that he might either be overlookt among the dead, or have received a charitable Interment from ſome unknown hand: I withdrew my ſelf into the confines of <hi>Spain,</hi> and being come among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> again, I

               <p>The ſorrowful <hi>Julian</hi> made this ſad end of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which the Dutcheſs had not been able to hear concluded without an aggravated affliction, and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Hands while a River of Tears flowed from her Eyes; <hi>Oh my Dear</hi> Niſe (ſaid ſhe) <hi>could Heaven pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Life of that Worthy Man to bring him to ſo diſaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an end! Ye Gods, where was your juſtice! where was your care of diſtreſſed Vertue, when he was ſuffered to fall by the violence of a Barbarous Multitude! O Heaven! why did you not ſend the charitable Governour time enough to prevent the ruine of ſo many Innocents!</hi> Her afflicted Favourite endeavoured all ſhe could to divert that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Grief ſhe tormented her ſelf with; but at laſt wanting ſtrength to complain longer, ſhe wrung her by the Hand, and ſaying with a faint Voice, <q>I muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my unhappy Lover to the other World, ſince I am denied him in this; ſhe ſunk down in her Arms.</q> 
                  <hi>Niſe</hi> immediately called in the reſt of her Women, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Julian</hi> to retire, they removed her into her Bed-Chamber, and undreſt her to give more freedom to her breath; but a great part of the day was ſpent before ſhe came to her ſelf, and ſeveral others before ſhe would be ſeen by any one, but her Women and <hi>Julian,</hi> whom ſhe ſometimes ſent for to hear that repeated, which as often renewed her ſorrow. The faithful <hi>Roman,</hi> after ſome Weeks abode in her Court, where by her Order he was ſupplied with every thing he could want, deſired leave to return to his Relations, whom he believed had concluded him dead, not having heard from him in ſo many months, but ſhe would by no means ſuffer him to leave her Court, 'till ſhe had found out ſome way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56696:43"/>
his Loyalty to his Maſter; ſo that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſatisfie himſelf with writing to <hi>Rome,</hi> while he attended the Dutcheſs commands in <hi>Mantua;</hi> whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition and Melancholy had made the Court change all its former ſplendor into ſorrow and diſturbance, none knowing what had reduced her to that condition, but all looking on <hi>Julian</hi> with unpleaſant eyes, as ſuppoſed the meſſenger who had brought her the information of what ſhe was ſo greatly troubled at. Two months were paſſed in this ſorrowful manner, when one day as <hi>Julian</hi> was diſcourſing with ſome of the <hi>Mantuan</hi> Lords, a foreign Merchant preſented himſelf to them, deſiring to know if the Dutcheſs would buy any choice Jewels, of which he had brought ſome ſtore to the Court: although they knew ſhe would not be diſturbed on any ſuch occaſion, yet for the ſatisfaction of their own curioſity, they deſired to ſee them; and opening a ſmall Casket, he expoſed to their view ſome of the faireſt had ever been ſeen in thoſe parts: <hi>Julian</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, and accidentally caſting his eyes on them as the Merchant pulled them forth, perceiving among the reſt a roſe of Diamonds, which he was confident he had ſeen before; and knowing if it was the ſame, it would open in the middle, he inquired of the Merchant whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would or not, who affirmed the negative; but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> taking it in his hand, perceived the place where it was to part, and by the Merchants help, drawing out a ſmall pin of Gold, it parted aſunder, which confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him it was the ſame he imagined; he told the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant he would adventure to deſire one of the Dutcheſſes women to ſhew it her; ſo going directly to <hi>Niſes</hi> Chamber, he deſired her to let him ſee the Dutcheſs, who going with him to her Preſence, as ſhe lay on her Bed, on his Knees he preſented the Jewel to her: As ſoon as ſhe had caſt her Eyes on it, Oh Heaven, (ſaid ſhe) this is the ſame I gave the unhappy <hi>Frederick;</hi> and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56696:44"/>
                  <hi>Niſe</hi> to her, ſhe opened it, and ſhewed her under the Gold the Diamonds were ſet in, her own Picture; and <hi>Julian</hi> aſſured her, that his Maſter had that Jewel hanging in his Boſome the day before he was ſlain. Immediately the Dutcheſs commanded the Merchant ſhould be brought in, pretending ſhe would divert her ſelf with ſeeing his Jewels; but as ſoon as he was come, <hi>Julian</hi> by her command, required of him how he came by that in the Dutcheſſes hand; He with a great deal of plaineneſs and aſſurance told her, that he bought it for a great ſum of money of a <hi>Jew</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the <hi>Jew</hi> told him, he had it of a Mooriſh Pirate in <hi>Argiers,</hi> that he believed the <hi>Moor</hi> had gotten it in ſome Prize he had met with at Sea; the Dutcheſs ſeeming ſatisfied with the Merchants truth, paid him the Price he demanded for it and diſmiſt him. After he was gone, as ſhe was buſied in looking on the Jewel ſhe had once given as a Pledge of her Love to <hi>Frederick,</hi> turning it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, her Picture which was drawn on a little Gold Plate, dropt out, and taking it up, ſhe perceived on the backſide of it ſome Letters as if ſcratched there by the point of a Needle, and peruſing them heedfully, not without a Tranſport of Joy, ſhe read theſe words, <hi>Fair Saint for thée I live, eſcapt the River and the fatal Rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How happy had <hi>Frederick</hi> been, could he have beheld the alteration there appeared in his adored Princeſſes face, at the imagination of his being ſtill alive: She gave <hi>Julian</hi> the Plate to read, not daring to credit her own Eyes, who was not able to contain himſelf, but kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down by the Dutcheſſes Bed; <q>He lives, Madam, (ſaid he,) my Deareſt Lord has been preſerved by the care of Heaven; I implore your permiſſion, that I may go immediately in ſearch of him, for I am reſolved never to reſt till I can find him, or learn ſome more certain news of him.</q> The Dutcheſs approved very well of <hi>Julians</hi> forwardneſs; but when ſhe began a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56696:44"/>
to recollect her ſelf, new apprehenſions aſſaulted her.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>'Tis probable, (ſaid ſhe to him) <hi>Frederick</hi> might eſcape after the Combate on the Rock, ſince his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy could no where be found, but if the Merchant ſpake true, is it not very likely he died by the hands of thoſe Pirates who ſold this Jewel, which I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he would never part with, but with his life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>Julian</hi> had the ſame fears, yet to keep the Dutcheſs from giving way to her melancholy, <q>Madam (ſaid he) 'tis without doubt there is much appearance of my Maſters being aſſaulted with freſh dangers, but ſince Heaven has been pleaſed to deliver him twice, where it was beyond a mortal imagination to think he did not periſh; ſuffer us to hope the beſt, when we have cauſe to be aſſured he lives, and can but doubt of his danger. Give me leave to put to Sea, and I am almoſt confident, in a few months I ſhall be able to bring you ſome news of him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> willing to comply with his deſires, as he was to go, the next day ordered a ſtrong Veſſel, well manned, and provided for a long Voyage to be got ready, wherein ſuch diligence was uſed, that in three dayes <hi>Julian</hi> took his leave of Her, having the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Ship given to him, and put to Sea with a fair wind.</p>

I came up to this place, and found him ready to expire, whom I knew to be Son of a Gentleman, whoſe quality is not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. <hi>Carlos</hi> you are Diſcreet and Generous, conſider whether it were juſt to let him quite expire without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording what aſſiſtance Pitty demands, if he be yet capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it; therefore I reſolve to conveigh him to the next Houſe, and ſince I have now waited a while for you, it cannot ſeem a diſreſpect to you; that I deſire you would ſtay my coming back while I am about an Act of ſo much Humanity (if you will not allow Piety) aſſuring you my Return ſhall be as ſudden as you can poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. <hi>Carlos</hi> was too Compaſſionate to deny ſo reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a requeſt, and offered to Accompany and Aſſiſt him in his Charitable Intention; which <hi>Alexander</hi> had much ado to prevent, though at laſt he prevailed with him to ſtay, and going to the Foot of the Tree, where it was too dark to know any Countenance, eſpecially one Pale, and in a deep Swoon, which <hi>Cynthia</hi> was again fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; <hi>Carlos</hi> himſelf Aſſiſted to Lift his own Siſter into his Arms, he was come thither to Kill, for having found him in her Chamber. Oh well deceived, too jealous <hi>Carlos:</hi> who could have told thee what the Night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, how Fortune baffled thee, and a Fiction delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee; Little didſt thou think thy Enemy <hi>Alexander</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56696:49"/>
was carrying away thy too ſtrictly obſerved <hi>Cynthia.</hi> He, whether it was ſome ſudden impulſe of what was the Truth, or whether his noble Diſpoſition would not ſuffer him to be left idle, while his Enemy was imployed in ſo pious an Action, followed him; and let <hi>Alexander</hi> uſe all the Arguments he could invent for his ſtay, they ſerved but as ſo many perſwaſions to draw him forward, ſo that he, was forced to keep on his way with the Lady on his Shoulders, though with the greateſt apprehenſions of Diſorder; he feared, what at another time he would with Prayers have wiſhed, that her fainted Spirits would return; for not knowing who was near her, her Voice would have betrayed what <hi>Alexander</hi> endeavoured ſo much to conceal; but although there was little appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of her coming to her ſelf, he was in no leſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, how to diſpoſe of <hi>Carlos</hi> when they came where Lights would be produced. While his Mind was agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſeveral conſiderations how to free himſelf of his Companion, they got to the Towns end, when <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> pretending an adjacent Houſe belonged to an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his, deſired <hi>Carlos</hi> would ſeek for a Chirurgeon, while he diſpoſed of the wounded Youth in his Friends Houſe; and as ſoon as <hi>Carlos</hi> was gone, knocking at the next door he came at, having told his Aſſiſtant he ſhould find him there; before any body came down to let him in, he parted with all the haſt he could through two or three of the Streets, to ſecure himſelf from meeting again with <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s already offended Brother; but then the freſh conſiderations how to diſpoſe of her, began to afflict him; if he carried her to his own houſe, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her there, would deſtroy his hopes of obtaining <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> ſince <hi>Carlos</hi> could be no way ſatisfied but by his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his Siſter; and if he placed her at home, <hi>Carlos</hi> muſt diſcover what happened; but at laſt, to ſecure his Love, and relying on <hi>Laura</hi>'s goodneſs, he determined to place her in her Brothers Houſe, under <hi>Laura</hi>'s Care,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56696:49"/>
who he believed might have her Cured without <hi>Carlos</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the real Cauſe of her indiſpoſition; thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, he haſted to the Garden-door of <hi>Carlos</hi>'s Houſe; where a few hours before, he had entred to have a ſight of <hi>Laura,</hi> and finding it open, paſſed on to the firſt Room, where he perceived his fair Charge begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her Spirits, but not able to ſpeak, he called aloud for <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Leonida;</hi> but none anſwered, nor could he hear any one ſtirring in the Houſe; he ſoon imagined they were either fled from <hi>Carlos</hi> diſpleaſure, or gone out to imploy ſome Friend to prevent the quarrel they knew him engaged in; but finding theſe delays would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for <hi>Cynthia,</hi> and accounting it barbarous to leave her there alone; he once more took her in his Arms, and going back the ſame way he had entred, went directly to the Houſe of a diſcreet antient Woman, whom he had confidence to rely on, having been the Nurſe of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Years; as ſoon as he came, he found a ready ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, and having acquainted the Charitable <hi>Ortenſia</hi> in ſhort, with the accident, he laid his fair burden on his Nurſes Bed, and taking a Light to ſee what condition ſhe was in; how was he ſurprized at the firſt glaunce he had of her Face; Oh Gods cried he out, tranſported with Grief! What has my Guilty hand done; <hi>Laura</hi> is dead, I have been the fatal Murderer of my adored <hi>Laura!</hi> But when he was going on with his exclamations, <hi>Ortenſia</hi> minded him, that if he would preſerve her Life he muſt haſt for a Chirurgeon; immediately he obeyed her, and after half an hours Abſence, returned with one whom he was acquainted with, and whoſe ſecreſie he durſt truſt; by that time he came back, <hi>Ortenſia</hi> and her Maid had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the wounded Lady, and got her to Bed, and with the help of Water and burning ſome things about her, brought her to her ſelf; the Chirurgeon after ſome inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, found ſhe had only received a wound in her Arm, but by the loſs of Blood, through fear and the Violence ſhe had
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56696:50"/>
undergone in being carried ſo farr, were the cauſes of her lying in ſo long a Swoon; as ſoon as her wound was dreſt, ſhe was left to her Repoſe, <hi>Ortenſia</hi> watching by her, and the skilful Chirurgeon rejoyced <hi>Alexander</hi> with the aſſurance that her health would be reſtored again in few days. The next Morning <hi>Alexander</hi> being permitted to Viſit her, found her in a much better condition, than he could have hoped in ſo ſhort a time; but his preſence, and the conſideration of where ſhe was, made her diſcover by her Bluſhes, and ſhame, the confuſion ſhe was in; which her paſſionate Lover endeavoured with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwaſions to remove, aſſuring her of all the Reſpect ſhe could command from one whoſe Life was dedicated to her Service; and after having at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt informed her of all that had paſt ſince ſhe received her unlucky wound, both of <hi>Carlos</hi> his accompanying Her to the Town, and of his own carrying her home where both <hi>Cynthia</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> were miſſing, he begged to learn from her why ſhe had diſſembled her own Name of <hi>Laura,</hi> and deceived him with that of <hi>Carlos</hi>'s Siſter; but juſt as ſhe was about to ſpeak, <hi>Ortenſia</hi> came in, and told him, that his Servant <hi>Fabricio</hi> whom he had ſent for, was come, and muſt needs ſpeak with him; he went out and preſently returned with a Letter in his hand, which having told his fair Miſtriſs, was ſent by <hi>Carlos,</hi> at her entreaty he read it to her; wherein <hi>Carlos</hi> accuſed him for a Coward, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name of a Gentleman, to hide himſelf from his juſt Reſentment; telling him that after he could learn nothing of him at the houſe where he promiſed to ſtay, he had returned and waited all night in the Park; but ſince he did not appear, he ſummoned him to meet that Morning in the ſame Place, if he would prevent being Poſted a Coward in the Afternoon; and that he might be ſatisfied with the wrongs were done by him, he had ſent in the Letter, the ſame Note was thrown by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56696:50"/>
the day before in <hi>Carlos</hi>'s Chamber, which was the appointment of that Meeting he had interrupted by coming Armed to him, which <hi>Carlos</hi> declared was his Siſters Hand, and <hi>Alexander</hi> had unawares, given it him among other Papers he had of him; <hi>Alexander</hi> was afreſh confuſed at the reading his Letter, admiring why he ſhould declare that <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s which he knew was thrown to him from <hi>Laura,</hi> but turning to the Charming Lady, and ſeeing her ſmile, he begged her if poſſible, to clear thoſe Doubts and Miſtakes he had ſo long lain under; which with a Charming ſweetneſs ſhe did; telling him that the occaſion of <hi>Carlos</hi> denying the Picture to be hers, was an effect of his innate Jealouſie, which ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, thereby with more Caution being able to try the ſincerity of his Love, and prevent her Brothers ſuſpition of her; but that being aſſured of his worth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of his Paſſion, ſhe deſigned the night before, when he came to her, to clear his Error, and give him leave to deſire her Brothers approbation of their Marriage; but finding as ſhe was coming to meet him, her brother there before her, and overhearing their appointment of a Duel in the Park, ſhe had put on a Suit of Boys Cloaths lay by her, which her Maid had got, and wore ſometimes to divert her in private; and followed him to the Park, with a Reſolution of imploring him not to draw his Sword againſt her Brother, when by his unlucky miſtake, ſhe had met that welcome he deſigned for <hi>Carlos;</hi> That the Story of the Duke and Marquis in <hi>Rome,</hi> was what had in ſome part happened to her ſelf, and occaſioned her Brothers Return from thence ſooner than he was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Alexander</hi> was as much delighted with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Beloved <hi>Laura</hi>'s being <hi>Carlos</hi>'s Siſter, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had been in diſorder with the fear of her being ſo; But not to detain your Highneſs too long in this part of their Adventures, I ſhall only add, that in few days the careful Chirurgeon reſtored her to the Health he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56696:51"/>
and <hi>Alexander</hi> having gained her conſent, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Prieſt, and was privately Married to her, before he ſtirred out of <hi>Ortenſia's</hi> Houſe, from the moment he had brought her thither. In the mean while, <hi>Carlos</hi> ignorant of all that had paſt, miſſing his Siſter from Home, and being able to learn no News of his Enemy, whom he ſuppoſed had ſtole her; engaged all his Friends to joyn with him in the Revenge he reſolved to take upon all <hi>Alexander's,</hi> and one Evening when I was there with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, to conſult what courſe was beſt, whereby to have his injuries ſatisfied, a Meſſenger came in and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him a Letter, told him that <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Siſter deſired the Company of him and his Friends to Supper with them at <hi>Alexanders</hi> Houſe; and opening the Letter, found they were Married, and wanted only his Approbation of what was done to compleat their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; at firſt he could ſcarce give way to his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but by his Friends perſwaſion, and the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration both of his new Brothers Birth, Fortune, and their antient Friendſhip, we prevailed with him to go; where, before the Company broke up, I was a joyful Witneſs of their firm Reconcilement, each accuſing and excuſing one another, with mutual endearments of Love and affection.</p>
               <p>For ſome days after their Marriage and this Fortunate Reconcilement, <hi>Alexanders</hi> Doors were continually crowded with Coaches of all the conſiderable people about the Court, to wiſh Joy to the new married Pair, in one of which <hi>Alfredo</hi> and <hi>Porcia</hi> being returned from <hi>Loretto,</hi> and coming by, inquired what was the occaſion of ſo much Concourſe in that place; and being informed of it by the firſt they examined, each looked on other, with no little diſorder in their Countenances; <hi>Alfredo</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> as a falſe friend, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him for his own ends, and <hi>Porcia</hi> not without Tears, complained of his ingratitude, and counterfeit Love, neither diſſembling their Reſentment, nor the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56696:51"/>
diſpleaſure they had conceived againſt one they thought had equally injured them both. But after a little ſtay they went on, not deſirous to hear a repetition of what created them ſo much trouble. <hi>Alfredo</hi> having left <hi>Porcia</hi> at her Fathers Houſe, retired to his own, each ſpending that night with a ſufficient inquietude, for what they had heard relating to <hi>Alexander;</hi> who the next day hearing of <hi>Alfredo's</hi> Return, made him a viſit, and by a full recital of his adventures to him, endeavoured to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the former Lover of <hi>Cynthia,</hi> how far he was from being his deſigned Rival, and of the impoſſiblity of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe than he had done, when all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were conſidered; which <hi>Alfredo</hi> accepted of as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, more than could be required from him, deſiring only the continuance of his Friendſhip, which <hi>Alexander</hi> as willingly promiſed; but if <hi>Alfredo</hi> was in appearance ſatisfied, and ſtrove to conceal that Love he could no longer publickly own, <hi>Porcia's</hi> thoughts were taken up with a more fatal Paſſion, reſolving to diſturb, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, their tranquility who had deprived her of all ſhe could expect or hope for. But as her reſolutions were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, ſhe was as cautious in working them to the event ſhe deſigned; and having a ready and pleaſing wit, beſides ſeveral accompliſhments which were generally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as well skilled both in Muſick, Singing and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, ſhe purpoſed to imploy all her faculties to propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate her wicked plot; and, to conceal all her malice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſpecious ſhow of kindneſs, ſhe daily viſited the young Bride, and appearing reconciled to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> who rejoyced in finding no worſe effect, of her diſpleaſure, ſhe ſo ingratiated her ſelf into the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the innocent <hi>Cynthia,</hi> that ſhe thought no time well ſpent when <hi>Alexander</hi> was abſent, if it was not compenſated by that of the inſinuating <hi>Porcia;</hi> they continued ſome time in agreeable converſation, during which, <hi>Alfredo,</hi> both as a friend of <hi>Alexanders</hi> and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56696:52"/>
of <hi>Porcia's,</hi> came ſo often to the Houſe, that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> (though not capable of jealouſie) began to think his aſſiduity more than needful; but unwilling to take any notice of it, he borrowed my Country-Houſe for a few days, and retired thither with his beloved Wife, pretending to be a little at reſt from the diſturbances of the Town, but indeed fairly to ſhake off <hi>Alfredo's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: <hi>Cynthia</hi> was very joyful to be in any place where <hi>Alexander</hi> was with her, but imagining the Country ſports would rob her of his Company, ſhe invited <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> to be her Companion in that Retirement, who as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted of it, having eaſily procured her Fathers licence to paſs ſome days in ſo vertuous Company. But when they were there, <hi>Alfredo</hi> continuing to be much in the Country, as he had been before in the Town, under the notion of viſiting his Couzen, <hi>Alexander</hi> was almoſt ready to deſire both him and his Kinſwoman to return home, which he had certainly done, if reſpect and fear of diſpleaſing his Dear <hi>Cynthia</hi> had not with-held him; but as cloſe as he carried his diſturbance at <hi>Alfredo's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, the ſubtile <hi>Porcia</hi> ſoon perceived it, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining her purpoſe grown ripe for execution; one After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon finding <hi>Alexander</hi> alone in the Garden, went to him, and appearing in a violent diſorder, told him, ſhe ſtill continued that reſpect for one had once been her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that ſhe could not brook his being injured without a ſenſible affliction to her ſelf; and after obliging him by her interrupted expreſſions, to urge her the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to know what ſhe had to ſay, dubiouſly hinted that ſhe could give him reaſons why he ought not to be too negligent of his reputation; <hi>Alexander</hi> at firſt believing ſhe only intimated what he had before thought, not to permit <hi>Alfredo</hi>'s too often viſits, appeared ſenſible of her care in mentioning it to him; but preſſing her to give him ſome reaſons of what had induced her to ſpeak on that Subject; after ſhe had made him urge it ſeveral
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56696:52"/>
times, ſeeming with much reluctance to bring out her words, ſhe told him that <hi>Cynthia,</hi> forgetful of what was moſt tender in the world, her Honour, had wronged him; <hi>Alexander</hi> enraged at ſo bold an accuſation of one he could not admit of an ill thought againſt in his Breaſt, falling into a rage, drew his Dagger, as if reſolved with her death, to expiate the Crime he held her guilty of, in profaning his Wives reputation, but the very ſight of it was enough to make her fall ſpiritleſs at his Feet, and a little recollecting himſelf, going to take her up, as he laid hold of her Arm, a note fell from her Sleeve, which haſtily taking up, he knew the hand had wrote it to be <hi>Cynthia's,</hi> ſo that leaving her as ſhe lay, he opened the Paper, and read with no leſs diſorder than he had put the Poſſeſſor of it into, theſe words:</p>
               <p>Alexander <hi>goes to Morrow to</hi> Mantua <hi>for a day or two, ſo that you may ſafely meet me in the ſame diſguiſe you have formerly done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> read it over ſeveral times, and being fully convinced it was his Wives writing, looking down on <hi>Porcia</hi> was ſorry for the fright he had put her into, and raiſing her up, in a little ſpace brought her to her ſelf again; who ſeeming offended at his raſhneſs, would have gone and left him, telling him his threats were an ill requital, for what ſhe had done, to preſerve his Honour, for which ſhe was willing to expoſe her wicked Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Alfredo</hi> to his reſentment, without conſideration of her near alliance to him; but <hi>Alexander</hi> holding her faſt, begged a thouſand pardons for what he had offered to do, deſiring her to conſider, that his Love and confidence of of his Wife were ſuch, that he could not with patience hear ſhe had injured him; and intreated her to let him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all ſhe knew concerning his then cruel Enemies; which ſhe cunningly did, telling him his Wives Maid had told her of their meeting often in the diſguiſe of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards Habits, which he knew his Wife had of late much
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56696:53"/>
affected to wear, and that he being to go to <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhe was employed to ſend <hi>Alfredo</hi> that Note, and deſired her to incloſe that in a Letter to him, but ſhe abhorring to be aſſiſtant in ſo wicked and injurious a deſign, having found him out, was reſolved to expoſe all their lives to his juſt anger, rather than his reputation ſhould be ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed by their private wickedneſs. <hi>Alexanders</hi> misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was ſuch, that, too eaſily overcome by her ſubtile inſinuation, and looking on the Bill as a too evident proof of his Wives falſhood, raiſed to the higheſt ſenſe of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation a man tender of his Honour could be, when he found it aſſaulted, and as he believed irreparably ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reſolved their Lives ſhould in part expiate the wrong they had done him; but to make his cruelty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more like an act of juſtice, than the effect of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided rage, by her councel he determined to ſend <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredo</hi> the Note; and pretending to proſecute his journey would return in private to an appointed place where <hi>Porcia</hi> ſhould meet, and direct him where his Abuſers were. With this reſolution they departed from the Garden, <hi>Porcia</hi> to purſue the effecting of her plot, and <hi>Alexander</hi> to lament the misfortunes he was fallen into, Love, Grief, Rage and Jealouſie combating in his Breaſt; what am I reduced to, did he ſay to himſelf? (having retired to give more ſcope to his grief, where there were no witneſſes of it;) can I hate, can I puniſh <hi>Cynthia,</hi> can I believe her innocence ever imagined a thought that might wrong me? No, no, I love her, I adore her now ſhe is my Wife more than ever; <hi>Porcia</hi> is falſe, and would abuſe me, <hi>Alfredo</hi> a Villain that would ſeduce her, but cannot; I'le acquaint my Dear <hi>Cynthia</hi> with her accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and be delighted to ſee her without diſturbance clear her ſelf from ſo vile an imputation. But is not this Note her own writing? (would he ſay again,) does ſhe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their meeting in a diſguiſe, when I am abſent? who knows, but ſhe formerly loved that Traytor <hi>Alfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:56696:53"/>
when he ſought to her Brother for her, but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; ſhe is but too apparently falſe; and, like the reſt of her diſſembling Sex, under the greateſt pretext of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, conceals moſt Devil: Baſe, Infamous <hi>Cynthia,</hi> thou haſt wronged me, and ſhalt dye for it, thy own Hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns thee; nor is it the effect of Jealouſie, but apparent Wrong thou haſt committed; Nay, had thy wickedneſs arrived no farther than the very writing ſuch a Note to a man that is not thy Husband, it were a ſin in him not to be forgiven by Heaven, ſhould he let it remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed. With this fatal determination he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſtrengthen himſelf againſt all the Approaches more tender Thoughts made upon him, and ſtrove to paſs the remainder of that tedious day, without the leaſt appearance in his Countenance either of trouble or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance; and towards Evening taking his leave of <hi>Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> and her Companion, went away, as he pretended, to <hi>Mantua;</hi> but as ſoon as it was quite dark he returned alone, and going into the Garden by a private door, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf in a little Summer-houſe till the time of executing his Revenge ſhould come, being confirmed in it, by having met, as he went towards <hi>Mantua, Alfredo</hi> in the diſguiſe was appointed him, walking towards his Lodge. <hi>Porcia</hi> in the mean time perceiving all things ſucceeded as ſhe had deſired, (for <hi>Alfredo,</hi> deceived by her, did really believe his hopes of overcoming <hi>Cynthia</hi> were near accompliſhed;) and having, after <hi>Alexanders</hi> departure, perſwaded his Wife to walk out and enjoy the pleaſure of a cool Evenings Air, both dreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Habit of Shepherdeſſes at <hi>Porcia's</hi> requeſt, who told her, that <hi>Alfredo</hi> would be in the Field in the ſame Dreſs, and divert them with ſome Muſick, which he did; and invited by his Couzen, waited on <hi>Cynthia</hi> back to her Houſe when it began to grow dark; as ſoon as ſhe came to the Garden, <hi>Cynthia</hi> taking her leave of him, with Excuſes that ſhe could not invite his ſtay all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56696:54"/>
Night in her Lords abſence, ſhe went in, and <hi>Porcia</hi> ſtaying behind, directed him to conceal himſelf in the Garden till it were time to carry him where he ſhould be Maſter of his wiſhes; and having diſpoſed of him, ſhe went to the Summer-houſe to <hi>Alexander,</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to heighten his rage, ſo ordered it, that <hi>Alfredo</hi> led <hi>Cynthia</hi> juſt under the Window as they came in, her ſelf and <hi>Leonida</hi> following at a diſtance, that <hi>Alexander</hi> might be more fully confirmed in the truth of what ſhe had told him: whom ſhe found in a diſorder ſuitable to what ſhe wiſhed, telling him, that <hi>Cynthia</hi> was gone in to ſtay till all his Servants were in Bed, and then ſhe would come down to bring <hi>Alfredo</hi> out of the Garden to her Chamber, but begged he would not ſhew himſelf till ſhe came again to him, when ſhe would carry him to the Room where he ſhould catch them together; which he promiſed, and diſmiſt her; but about half an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, grown impatient of longer delay, he went out, and come almoſt to the Door of the Houſe, juſt as he ſaw a man and woman going into it, ſo that aſſured it was <hi>Afredo</hi> and his Wife, not able longer to with-hold his fury, he run to them, and ſhot <hi>Alfredo</hi> with a Piſtol he had provided, ſeconding his blow with ſtabbing a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into <hi>Cynthia's</hi> breaſt, whereby they both fell dead at his feet, without uttering a word or dying groan; and not ſatisfied therewith, he haſted into the Houſe, and beſtowed the ſame puniſhment on <hi>Leonida</hi> for her treachery; but neither deſigned nor imagined he had done any hurt to <hi>Porcia,</hi> and afterwards hearing of her being wounded, concluded he had in the dark miſtaken her for <hi>Leonida.</hi> Thus far, continued <hi>Ceſario,</hi> I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted your Highneſs with the Adventures of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Friend, to the time he found ſhelter at your feet, from the purſuit of thoſe Peaſants would have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him; but in the time hath paſſed ſince, there have many things hapned, which I hope, will more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

               <p>The Dutcheſs being told it was late, deferred hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the concluſion of <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſtory till the next day; when ſhe commanded he ſhould be brought before her, promiſing to ſentence him, either with rigour or favour, as <hi>Carlos</hi>'s ſtory ſhould diſcover his guilt or innocence; and accordingly in the morning, as ſoon as the Dutcheſs appeared abroad, <hi>Cynthia's</hi> Brother was commanded to her preſence, who led a Lady veiled by the hand, which being a thing not permitted in the Preſence, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be taken off, and the Lady was known to be the ſuppoſed murdered <hi>Cynthia.</hi> As ſoon as the Dutcheſs was informed who ſhe was, with a ſatisfaction to behold her living, whom ſhe had with pity condoled as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſlain, ſhe received her with more than a common kindneſs; and being earneſtly deſirous to know how ſhe had eſcaped her Husbands miſguided rage, <hi>Carlos,</hi> being commanded to give her an account of it, after his duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubmiſſion to her, continued where <hi>Ceſario</hi> had broke off.</p>
               <p>Your Highneſs (ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to the Dutcheſs) has been acquainted with the rigour <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> uſed to thoſe he thought guilty of blemiſhing his Honour. <hi>Porcias</hi> deſigns, and the circumſtances I am now to acquaint your Highneſs with, were learned from <hi>Leonida</hi> my Siſters Maid, who ſo long ſurvived the wound <hi>Alexander</hi> had given her, as to confeſs the wrong ſhe had done her Miſteſs, and begging her pardon, to adviſe her ſhe would for a while ſecure her ſelf from an apparently well-grounded rage might prove fatal to her: my Brother in-law that Night believing he had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently chaſtiſed the ruiners of his Honour, left the Houſe, and retired into the adjacent Fields, while my Siſter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56696:55"/>
ſecure in her Chamber from any apprehenſions of ſo bloody a Tragedy, hearing a Piſtol go off, and the ſhrieks of her Maid, when ſtabbed by <hi>Alexander,</hi> was at firſt ſurprized with ſo much fear, that ſhe had not boldneſs enough to ſtir from her Chamber; but at laſt venturing forth, protected by her innocence, the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhe met with was <hi>Leonida</hi> bleeding on the Floor; as ſoon as that unhappy Maid ſaw her Miſtreſs with a Light in her Hand, raiſing her ſelf a little; Ah Madam (ſaid ſhe with a feeble voice) beware of your incenſed Husband, who deſigns your death for a crime you are moſt innocent of: my Siſter ſurprized with what ſhe ſaid, without offering to retire, deſired her to declare what had been the occaſion of her lying in that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition; Ah Madam! (ſaid the dying <hi>Leonida</hi>) forgive my falſhood, and let my crimes dye with me. You have formerly heard my Maſter had expreſſed ſome kindneſs to <hi>Porcia,</hi> and that <hi>Alfredo</hi> adored your Beauty. When ſhe returned with her unhappy Couzen from <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi> finding you were married to him ſhe hoped would have been her Husband, reſolving, if poſſible, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, ſhe inſinuated her ſelf into your affection, and promiſing <hi>Alfredo</hi> ſhould marry me if I would be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in propagating her deſign, ſhe endeavoured to raiſe <hi>Alexanders</hi> jealouſie to ſuch a height, that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing you to his reſentment, as a reward of her care to preſerve his Honour, as ſoon as you were dead he ſhould in gratitude let her ſupply your place; and to effect it, ſhe deceived the overfond <hi>Alfredo,</hi> with a belief, that by her means you ſhould be reduced to gratifie his wicked deſires, obliging him to come diſguiſed to the Village, that malicious Peaſants ſhould not take notice of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity, at the ſame time deceiving you with a pretence that he came to court her, and me that all tended to your ruine, and the making him my Husband; but in a long time being able to ground no jealouſie ſtrong
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56696:55"/>
enough to poſſeſs <hi>Alexanders</hi> Breaſt with a prejudice againſt one he ſo intirely loved; ſhe cut her right hand on purpoſe, and coming bleeding to you, as if done by miſchance, ſhe intreated you would write a Note to him as from her, deſiring he would come the next Night diſguiſed as he uſed to do; which as ſoon as you had done (as ſhe her ſelf told me) ſhe ſhewed it to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and ſent him another, by which means ſhe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he had been inſtigated to ſo much cruelty, and had (miſtaking her for my Siſter) given her a juſt reward of her treachery. Then begging ſhe would for a while ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her ſelf from her Husbands fury, and grant her a remiſſion of her offence, ſhe reſigned her life. My Siſter terrified and amazed, ran immediately out, and wandring all Night in the Fields, came the next day to my Houſe, giving me an account of what had paſſed; I was reſolved to endeavour a ſudden reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to that purpoſe was ſending in ſearch of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when my Friend <hi>Ceſario</hi> came to me, and told me he was made a Priſoner by your Highneſs order. My Siſter, what with her grief and fright, was taken with ſo violent a Feavour, that for many days her life was deſpaired of: and if ſhe had died I reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute <hi>Alexander</hi> as her Murderer; but Heaven having been pleaſed, after a tedious ſickneſs to reſtore her health, and finding ſhe lamented the impriſonment of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; I had long ſince brought her to implore his life of your Highneſs, had not <hi>Ceſario</hi> aſſured me your indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition denied any acceſs to be had to You; and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Directions, I have now brought her to begg You would pardon his ſeverity againſt thoſe, who either had, or really deſigned to offend him, and make her happy in being reſtored to a Husband ſhe ſo dotingly loves.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion of <hi>Carlos</hi> ſtory which was followed by <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s begging for <hi>Alexanders</hi> Life on her Knees, ſo ſenſibly touched the compaſſionate Dutcheſs; that ſhe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56696:56"/>
commanded the Priſoner to be ſent for, and making <hi>Cynthia</hi> retire, after the whole Story had been repeated to him, ſo as if his Wife were really dead, and he had with Tears lamented his miſtaken cruelty ſhe, was brought forth, and with an unexpreſſible joy received into his Arms, imploring a thouſand times her Pardon for his unjuſt ſuſpition, which ſhe as eaſily granted to one ſo much beloved by her. The Dutcheſs delighted with their happy reconcilement, commanded <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould be diſcharged from his Impriſonment, allowing the Death of thoſe he had ſlain, but a juſt puniſhment of their wickedneſs. But if the happy pair lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the tranquility imaginable; after two Months were expired from the time of <hi>Julians</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Dutcheſs began to entertain new fears of <hi>Fredericks</hi> being loſt, and directed by a violent impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhe went every day to the Sea ſide, hoping for a ſight of the Veſſel was to bring back the Meſſenger gone in ſearch of her <hi>perſecuted Lover;</hi> One Morning after the Sea had raged two days before with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm, the impetuoſity of its Fury being then aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as far as they could diſcern, a Ship appeared ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards the Haven, and ſome hours after, being come up fair with the Shore, it was known to be the ſame which <hi>Julian</hi> had the command of. The Dutcheſs being told of it, was about to order a Boat on Board, when they diſcerned that of the Ship, put off to come to Land. If the Princeſs was delighted with the expectation of ſeeing <hi>Julian</hi> again, hoping he would be as good as his Word, never to return till he had learnt ſome News of his Maſter; on the other ſide ſhe was aſſaulted with fears, that he had only ſent back the Veſſel, while he proceeded by Land in his earneſt ſearch; But that diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance was ſoon over, when ſhe ſaw the Loyal Servant of <hi>Frederick</hi> come to throw himſelf at her Feet, and as ſhe imagined, with a Countenance which fore-boded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56696:56"/>
of ill; as ſoon as he had paid his Duty to her, and kiſſed her hand, having no longer patience to defer her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry: leaning on <hi>Niſe</hi>'s Arm, ſhe walked a little diſtance from the Company, and finding they were out of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <q>What <hi>Julian</hi> (ſaid ſhe) have you been firm to your promiſe? Shall I hear that your Lord is ſafe?

               <p>YOur Highneſs may pleaſe to remember, I told you of my ſeing my maſter fall dead, as I thought, among his Enemies on the <hi>Lovers Rock;</hi> How long he continued deprived of his Sences, he could not well tell; But being in the ordinary dreſs of a Slave, by what we could ſince conjecture, it was his Chance to be thrown one of the Laſt into the Pitt among the dead <hi>Moors</hi> by the Governor of <hi>Antiquera</hi>'s Order; and that by being taken up and ſtirred, his Spirits began to be agitated, ſo that he came to open his Eyes again; when having a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Recovered his Underſtanding, and hearing all quiet near him, he began to look about, and found himſelf lying upon a heap of dead Bodies; after a great deal of ſtrugling, he made a ſhift to get out of the Pit, but not believing he had Strength to walk where he might
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56696:57"/>
get help, and his wounds bleeding a freſh by his ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſat down, patiently to reſign his Life, while his thoughts were imployed in the contemplation of your Beauty, which he beheld in the Picture, was brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afterwards, by the ſtranger Merchant. But as he declared to me, the ſight of your Image before his Eyes, made him offer up his Prayers to Heaven, that he might live once more to behold his adored Original, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving if his wounds were ſtopt from bleeding more, he might have Strength left to get down the Rock, where ſome Paſſenger might ſee him; he pulled the Wreath from a Turbant lay near him, and girt it about his waſt as ſtrait as he could, finding he loſt moſt Blood from a wound on his Side. In that Poſture he continued about an hour, when impatient of a hopeleſs delay, not able to riſe, he crawled to the deſcent of the Rock, and from thence ſuffered himſelf to ſlide by degrees, till he was almoſt at the bottom; but then he grew ſo weak, that he was not able to move himſelf a ſtep farther, and after he had remained ſo about half an hour, as the Sun was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining apace towards the Weſt, he ſaw at a diſtance a Party of about forty Horſe, who were Croſſing about, as if they purpoſed to take a View of the Country, in Order to ſome Deſigne; he had not ſtrength to call out, or if he had, they were at too great a diſtance to be heard; and withal, confident they were <hi>Moors,</hi> he imagined their diſcovery of him, would rather anticipate his Death, than be a means of preſerving his Life; ſo that he continued ſitting on the ground when he ſaw the Horſemen draw towards the Rock; and coming pretty near, one of the Company Alighted with a ſeeming pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to climb up to the top of it; but as he looked about, ſeeing a Man all Bloody, he came to my Maſter, and asked him how he had fallen into that Condition: who with a true deceit, thereby to encourage their Aſſiſtance of him, anſwered with a faint Voice <hi>Arabick;</hi> in fighting with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56696:58"/>
Chriſtians; as ſoon as the Moor heard what he ſaid, turning back, he went to the reſt of the Company, and preſently returned with two more; they asked him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral queſtions; but finding he had not ſtrength to ſpeak, they took him up in their Arms, and putting him upon a quiet Horſe, with a Man behind to hold him up, carried him away to a little Town about a League off, where one of the Company, whoſe Profeſſion it was, ſearched and dreſſed his wounds; telling him withal, he ſhould not be diſcouraged, for that none of them were Mortal; he continued the next day and night in that little Village; but ſo weak that he could not utter a word loud enough to be heard; and the <hi>Moors</hi> who had taken care of him, being to depart, they procured a Cart to lay him on, and ordered it to follow ſoftly after them to <hi>Cordova,</hi> he that was the Chirurgion ſtaying with him: there had paſt a week from the time of his being hurt, to that of their Arrival at the City, and the next day after it, his wounds being in a fair way of Cure, and his Spirits ſo much reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that he could, and was by his Chirurgion allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak; the Chief of thoſe who had delivered him from the Rock, came to ſee him; and telling him he was Son to the General of <hi>Cordova,</hi> and ſent out to make ſome Diſcovery, which way <hi>Antiquera</hi> might be aſſaulted, when he found him in that weak Condition at the Foot of the white Rock, believing it was an extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter had reduced him almoſt to his end; That both out of Charity, and a deſire to know how he came by his wounds, he was induced to give Order that if poſſible, his Life ſhould be preſerved, and now that there was ſome appearance of it, he deſired in requital of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he would ſatisfy his Curioſity in what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to know of him. My Maſter was very willing to comply with his deſire, having had time to conſider what Account was propereſt to give of his Misfortunes, ſo that after returning him thanks with much acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56696:58"/>
of his kindneſs to him; I muſt confeſs, noble Deliverer (ſaid my Maſter) that I am deſcended of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents, but having ſpent much time in <hi>Africa</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Tunis,</hi> I may reckon my ſelf indebted to the <hi>Moors</hi> for part of my Education. I ſerved that King ſome time in his Wars with ſo much Succeſs, that his goodneſs thought the greateſt things he could do for me, ſuch as he had no reaſon to wiſh unbeſtowed; and being young, and deſirous to ſee a Country ſo much celebrated as this is, for the Wars between you and the Chriſtians. I took my leave of him and accompanied <hi>Hamet,</hi> one of his principal Subjects, who came over hither on an Embaſſy from him. We arrived ſome time ſince at <hi>Malaga,</hi> and that Morning you met me, having travelled ſo far in to the Country, there was upon the Rock a ſharp Diſpute between ſome Chriſtians and <hi>Hamets</hi> Party, and there after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wounds, I fell, remaining as dead for a long time; but coming to my ſelf, I lay upon a Heap of dead Bodies all of <hi>Hamets</hi> Party, but how he happened to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, I am able to give you no Account off. The <hi>Moor</hi> was much pleaſed with the ſhort Narrative my Maſter gave, and conjectured what was really true, that a Party from <hi>Antiquera</hi> might have fallen on them, and either ſlain or made them all Captives. After this, if my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was uſed with a Charitable Civility before, they now gave him Reſpect as the Favourite of a King, and great Souldier, being viſited by moſt of the conſiderable Men in that Court. And after ſix weeks, his wounds being ſo well, that he was able to walk abroad, his Friend car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to wait on the King, having provided him Rich Garments of the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Faſhion. He was very urgent to oblidge his continuance with him, and to have him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Command in his Army againſt the Chriſtians; which my Maſter not without difficulty was excuſed from, urging the neceſſity of his Removal, to inquire what was become of thoſe he had accompanied from <hi>Tunis.</hi>

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56696:59"/>As ſoon as he was perfectly cured, though with regret of thoſe he left, he took his leave of <hi>Cordova,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accommodated with Horſes to <hi>Valencia,</hi> there upon pretence of ſecurity to Travel, he got a Paſs from the Chriſtian Garriſons, and being brought to the neareſt, by <hi>Moors</hi> he had hired, making uſe of his Paſs for their Return, as ſoon as they were without the Walls, he made the Governor a Viſit, and diſcovered himſelf to be a <hi>Sicilian;</hi> and giving him a Relation of ſome of his Adventures he ſo much obliged him, that he not only made him his own Gueſs for ſome days he ſtayed there, (both to reſt himſelf not yet able to endure a long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and to change his <hi>Mooriſh Habit</hi> he then wore) but ſupplied him with all things neceſſary both for his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Voyage, which was ſuccesful enough, not only while he Travelled by Land, but for ſome days after, he had put to Sea in a Veſſel bound hither; one day as he was ſitting on the Deck, pleaſed with the hopes of being ſoon at <hi>Mantua,</hi> which the Maſter promiſed him a ſight of in two days, if the Wind continued fair; holding your Picture in his hand, He with the point of a Knife engraved thoſe words, gave you the firſt Intelligence of his being alive. That Night the Wind was fair and freſh, but in the Morning a general Fright ſeized all the Mariners, when they beheld not a mile to windward of them, a large Ship, by whoſe Antiant they knew her to be a Turkiſh Pirate of <hi>Algier;</hi> in leſs than an hour ſhe came cloſe up with them, and commanding the Maſter to ſtrike his ſails and yield, No perſwaſions of my Lords could prevail with them to ſtand on their defence, not being above twenty in number, half Paſſengers, and in the <hi>Turks</hi> Ship near three hundred Men: only the Maſter adviſed all his Paſſengers to throw away their beſt Cloaths, that their Ranſomes might be the more moderate; which they al did except my Lord, who though he ſtood with his Sword in his hand reſolved to ſell his Life at as dear a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56696:59"/>
rate as he could; yet as ſoon as they were Boarded, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred with numbers, he was made a Captive among the reſt, and ſtripped both of all his Cloaths, and what was deareſt to him in the World, next your ſelf, the Picture was taken from him; the Turks as ſoon as they had ſearched their Prize, taking all the Priſoners on Board their own Ship, ſent the other with ſome of their own Men, home to <hi>Algier,</hi> laden with all the Booty they had taken; themſelves keeping out at Sea for more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; ten days after their Captivity, about noon the Turks eſpied a Sail and giving her Chaſe, found in a ſhort time, that ſhe endeavoured as much to get up with them, ſo that preparing for a Fight, they ſhut up their Priſoners under Hatches, leaving only half a dozen of the Luſtieſt on the Deck, to help them at their work in ordering the Tackle, among which my Maſter happened to be one. The Ship which they had diſcovered making them to be Turks, about an hour before Sunſet, was come up ſo near them, that on each ſide they began to make uſe of their great Shot, having put abroad the Colours of <hi>Sicily:</hi> for they durſt not adventure on either part to Board, the Wind being very freſh and the Sea running as high. Now Madam, I muſt acquaint you with a deſperate Attempt of my always undaunted Lord, who percieving a Ship of his own Country ſo near, and he engaged on the contrary part, reſolving either on death or Liberty, ſnatching up a Headpiece lay on the Deck, he clapt it on, and half naked as the Turks had made him, leapt into the Sea; with an intent to get on Board the Ship of his Countrymen; the Pirates ſeeing him ſwiming in the Water, made ſeverel Shots at him with their Arrows, ſome of which were directed ſo well, that the Helmet preſerved his Life, the Waves being a ſufficient Armour for the reſt of his Body; and the <hi>Sicilians</hi> perceiving what paſſed, uſed ſo much diligence to recover him on Board them, that bearing up to him
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56696:60"/>
and throwing out a Rope, which he laid hold of, they got him ſafe into their Veſſel; The Fight continued ſome time after, till the Wind increaſing, and Night coming on, decided the Controverſie; and the next Morning they were out of ſight of their Enemies. When they were at quiet from the Turks, the Captain of the <hi>Sicilians</hi> hearing my Maſter was his Country-man, ſent for him into his Cabbin, to examine who he was? but could learn nothing more, than that he was deſcended of honeſt Parents in <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and had ſpent moſt of his Time in Travel, having been ſeveral years in Captivity; but was in requital of what he ſaid, informed by the Captain, that the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> dying about two Months before without Heirs, the Crown was deſcended to Count <hi>Frederick</hi> in the right of his Mother, who was Niece to the deceaſed King; and that He guided by a Youthful curioſity, had ſome years before left his Country to Travel, not being then ſo much as the preſumptive Heir to the Crown, the King having a Son living who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the flower of his Youth, two years before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and being further examined by my Maſter how the Government was at preſent managed, he told him that by the Kings will, the Councel had taken the Charge of all affairs, untill the Return of their Prince, having ſent out ſeveral Ships to all Ports of the Continent therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts to inquire if poſſible they could learn any News of him, and that himſelf was abroad upon that Account; If my Maſter was ſurprized with an unexpected Joy to find himſelf after being ſo happily reſtored to his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the expected Succeſſor to a Crown, he declared to me that the delight he received from ſuch an alteration of his Condition, was chiefly that he had a Preſent by it, not unworthy your Highneſs acceptance; but to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue my Diſcourſe continued <hi>Julian,</hi> (finding how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what he ſaid was to the Dutcheſs) after the Captain
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56696:60"/>
of the Ship had fully ſatisfied him in all circumſtances which ſo nearly concerned him; but how can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (ſaid my Maſter) to find the Prince you are in ſearch of, when by a long abſence his Contenance is not known to any of you; 'tis true, replied the Captain, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ſelf, nor any in this Ship know him, but ſhould any but the true Prince declare himſelf ſuch, when he arrived in <hi>Sicily,</hi> there are enew who are acquainted with him; then ſaid my Maſter, as ſoon as you arrive in <hi>Sicily,</hi> be aſſured you ſhall have a certain intelligence where he is. The Captain and all his Company over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at news ſo little expected, from that moment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their Coarſe homewards, and being favoured with a fair wind, in few days came to an Anchor under the Walls of <hi>Meſſina;</hi> my Maſter all that while keeping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concealed; and going a-ſhore with the Captain, they went together to the Councel, which upon their landing they heard was ſitting; but before they entred into the Palace, ſome of my Maſters former acquaintance, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowing him, immediately the news ran through the whole City, that their King was returned; which being ſoon confirmed on all hands, never were acclamations greater than the <hi>Sicilians</hi> expreſſed at that time. The Counſel the next day reſigned the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his hands, and not many after he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Crowned: But that his happineſs might not be too compleat, while he was ſolicitous in ſetling the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State, that he might haſten his Voyage hither to lay his Crown at your Feet; a ſudden information de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of all that joy he thought incapable of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; for a Ship arriving in the Port from <hi>Mantua,</hi> the King commanded the Captain of her to attend him, that he might inquire ſome news of your Highneſs; the ignorant Seaman told him, the common Diſcourſe of this place was, that your marriage would ſpeedily be conſummated with the Prince of <hi>Mayorca,</hi> who a few

days before his departure was arrived there for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of it. The occaſion of this report, I preſume, your Highneſs knows was grounded upon the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent appearance of that Prince in your Court, with hopes of accompliſhing his deſign; but finding how averſe you was to the alteration of your condition, ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with diſappointment to his own Country. The information my Prince received from the deceived Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; was (as he told me) an affliction too ſenſible to be expreſſed; and he has ſince condemned himſelf for being ſo weak as to upbraid you of inconſtancy, though he confeſſed, the reaſon you had to believe him long before dead, might be a ſufficient excuſe for your making choice of ſo conſiderable a Prince to be your Husband; however this diſturbance, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your being anothers, made him negligent of ſending to acquaint you, either that he was living, or of the alteration Heaven was pleaſed to make in his condition; and in this State I found his affairs when I arrived at <hi>Sicily;</hi> having after I departed from your Highneſs ſpent a month at Sea, in a fruitleſs ſearch; till coming in ſight of that Iſland, more out of a deſire to ſee the Country had given birth to my Lord, than any expectation of hearing any thing concerning him, I put into the Harbour, and going a-ſhore, I was informed by ſome perſons I met on the ſtrand, what a general joy the Iſlanders were filled with upon the return of their long abſent King, who was Crowned a few days before; and being offered by them to be brought to his preſence, which I accepted; your Highneſs may pleaſe to gueſs how much I was ſurprized to find my Maſter in the perſon of their King: his goodneſs was always too great to me, to be forgotten by him, ſo that I was ſcarce advanced half way in the preſence, when he roſe, and taking me up from my knee, in which poſture I had put my ſelf, he welcomed my return with a kindneſs much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56696:61"/>
beyond what I could have expected for more eminent ſervices than I had ever been able to do for him; he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my deliverance from the Rock, and how I had ſpent my time ſince; which having told him in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> for the moſt part, I was not a little amazed, to perceive he took no notice of my words, or ſo much as inquired whether you were living or no? And a while after taking me a-part from the Company; what, (<hi>Julian,</hi> ſaid he,) is my miſery amidſt all this triumph, ſince the inconſtant <hi>Diana</hi> could ſo ſoon forget me? And fetching a deep ſigh, by his ſilence gave me leave to ſpeak; which I did, telling him, how concerned you had been at the thoughts of his death, and that by a ſurmiſed probability that he might ſtill be living, You had ſent me in ſearch of him; at which words he ſtopt my proceeding in what I would have ſaid: How is it poſſible (ſaid he) that you can pretend to deceive me with the imagination, that my life can be of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to her, who is now Wife to the Prince of <hi>Majorca?</hi> Sir, replied I, preſuming to interrupt him; what unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py miſtake has given you an unneceſſary diſturbance? for that Prince you name, though 'tis true he arrived at <hi>Mantua</hi> with hopes of being favoured by the Princeſs, he found her reception ſo cool, that after a ſhort ſtay he returned diſappointed of his pretences: ſhe is ſtill unmarried, and wiſhes nothing more than to hear of your ſafety. The effect my diſcourſe wrought on him, is beyond my capacity to expreſs. He took me in his Arms, embracing me a thouſand times, and calling me his <hi>Genius,</hi> his Good Angel. Is it poſſible Dear <hi>Julian?</hi> ſaid he, that my Princeſs is not married, and that ſhe ſtill retains a favourable thought of her faithful <hi>Frederick.</hi> Oh! I muſt fly to her, and throw my ſelf at her feet, to beg pardon for my wicked ſuſpition of her goodneſs. With ſuch Tranſports he entertained himſelf for a long time; and in the concluſion, not able to brook any delay,
<pb facs="tcp:56696:62"/>
the ſame Evening he gave me a letter to your Highneſs, with order that I ſhould embarque that Night, and ſail for <hi>Mantua,</hi> to aſſure you, that as ſoon as ever he could get his Navy to Sea, he would come with it hither to lay the Crown of <hi>Sicily</hi> at the Feet of his moſt adored Princeſs.</p>
               <p>The ſatisfaction <hi>Julian</hi> gave the fair Dutcheſs by his relation, was greater than her modeſty would expreſs, even before thoſe ſhe had an entire confidence in. But that <hi>Frederick</hi> might be received with all the Grandeur and State imaginable, ſhe ſuffered his coming to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and on what deſign; which ſoon produced as great a joy in <hi>Mantua,</hi> as the <hi>Sicilians</hi> had expreſſed at the arrival of their King. But amidſt all theſe trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant preparations, a ſudden accident, put all the Court into confuſion. For <hi>Alvaro,</hi> the young Prince of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca,</hi> being equally captivated with the Beauty and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Diana,</hi> and perceiving that his publick addreſſes were ſlighted by her, reſolved to attempt that by a treacherous force, which he was perſwaded no aſſiduity or reſpect would procure. So that although he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take a ſolemn leave, both of the Dutcheſs and <hi>Mantua;</hi> yet having by conſiderable preſents gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of the Court to aſſiſt him, he reſolved to ſteal, and carry her forcibly with him to <hi>Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:56696:62"/>
League from the Town, which, a <hi>Mantuan,</hi> bribed by him, had procured for his concealment, reſolving to wait there for an opportunity of putting his plot in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; where he was detained much longer than he expected, being unable to offer at any thing ſo long as the Dutcheſs kept within her Palace, or ſeldom ſtirred out, and when ſhe did, only to the Sea-ſide, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue too great for him to attempt any thing againſt. Thus he continued from the Time of <hi>Julians</hi> departure, till after he was returned again; at laſt reſolving to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from his enterprize, eſpecially when the Veſſel wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, not able to give any good account of her long ſtay in ſo private a place as ſhe was laid up in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a command to depart out of hand, unleſs ſhe would be ſeized as being either a Spy or Pirate. But when he was almoſt ready to depart, one of his gained Friends aſſured him, that in one day more he might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his deſign; which he found as eaſie means for the execution of as he could wiſh; for the Dutcheſs, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day abroad after <hi>Julians</hi> return, ſpending no Evening out of the pleaſant Iſland-Garden upon the River <hi>Po,</hi> where ſhe uſually retired with her Favourite <hi>Niſe</hi> and the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Kings Loyal Servant, to hear him repeat the adventures of his Maſters life. <hi>Alvaro</hi> having provided all things neceſſary for his purpoſe, landed from a ſmall Barque on the back ſide of the Garden, with ſix men well armed in his Company, and wanting no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, came to the very Arbour ſhe was retired to, without being diſcovered by any of her Attendants who waited on the other ſide for her; and while two of his Servants aſſaulted <hi>Julian,</hi> who endeavoured to defend the Princeſs, himſelf with the reſt carried her and <hi>Niſe</hi> by force into the Boat, and Rowing away with all the ſpeed they could, landed her where a Chariot waited their coming and carrying them out of the Boat into it, himſelf bearing them Company to prevent their

leaping forth, drove away with all the ſpeed they could, for the Village near which the Ship lay. His two men that fell upon <hi>Julian</hi> being left behind, were by thoſe who came running in, hearing the claſhing of their Swords, and the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> and <hi>Niſes</hi> ſhrieks, cut to pieces; and although all poſſible dilligence was uſed to purſue them, he had got her aboard his Veſſel, and was under ſail by that time thoſe who were come after him reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Village he had newly left; and immediately the Night coming on, now ſecure of his prize, he went into the Cabbin he had placed the Dutcheſs in, endeavouring to prevail with her for a pardon of that violence, the height of Paſſion, as he pretended, had prompted him to: but for almoſt a Week that they ſailed, without meeting with any interruption in their Voyage, he could obtain nothing from the afflicted Princeſs, but that ſhe would rather dye than yield to that compulſion he thought to eſtabliſh his love by. During which time, that the amorous Prince had no other enemy to encoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter but <hi>Diana's</hi> obſtinate diſdain; Her loyal Subjects were not idle, but fitted out all the Ships were in the Port to purſue him; and the <hi>Sicilian</hi> King ignorant of this new misfortune, was got to Sea with a Royal Fleet; when coming within two days ſail of <hi>Mantua,</hi> he met a Veſſel was come out from thence, which gave him the ſad account of his Princeſſes Rape; upon which fatal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, having lamented her misfortune and his own, with all the expreſſions of a violent grief: he altered his coarſe, and ſtood away to Sea in chaſe of the deteſted Raviſher of the Dutcheſs, being aſſured by all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he was the Prince of <hi>Majorca.</hi> Who while the Seas were ſpread with Ships to diſcover him, imployed all his time in endeavouring to reconcile himſelf to the Dutcheſs; whoſe juſt indignation, ſhe aſſured him could never be removed, but by his returning her back to her own Country; which he made as much haſte from as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56696:63"/>
the winds would give him leave; and nine days after his leaving <hi>Mantua,</hi> early in the Morning the Captain of the Veſſel called him upon the Deck to ſee his own Iſland, promiſing to land him on it by Noon; but in leſs than an hour they were ſo becalmed, that the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel made no way; and when they had got out their great Oars, to ſupply with them the want of a Gale, at firſt an eaſie one began to blow, but ſo exactly off the ſhore, that it drove them faſter to Sea than their Oars could work them towards the Land; and freſhening upon them, before it was dark they had again loſt ſight of the place, the Prince hoped by that time to have been a-ſhore at: all Night it blew ſo freſh, that they were almoſt compelled to bear up before it; and the next day about Sunriſe, they found themſelves chaſed by two Veſſels which ſeemed to gain upon them. <hi>Alvaro</hi> who feared all to be Enemies, to prevent their coming up with him, ſtood away with the Wind, the Ships following his coarſe, which they continued to do all day, and a little before Night were come up ſo near, that they diſcovered them to be <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuans.</hi> The afflicted Dutcheſs, hoped from the firſt of their coming in ſight, to find them her Delievers; but when ſhe was told the Ships belonged to her, or her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and doubtleſs abroad in perſuit of her Raviſher; ſhe offered up her prayers to Heaven that they might reach the Ship ſhe was in; but finding the Night would be a means to loſe them again, ſeeing <hi>Alvaro</hi> come into the Cabbin, ſhe turned from the Window ſhe was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at, and throwing her ſelf at his feet, with Tears implored him to reſtore her to her freedom, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him ſhe would forgive all he had hitherto done againſt her; But his love was too great to forego a prize he now began to hope would be again ſecured to him; and accordingly as ſoon as it was dark, commanding there ſhould be no Lights in the Ship, he altered the coarſe he had run all day: and as he expected, in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56696:64"/>
morning was out of ſight of thoſe had chaſed him the Day before; the Wind continuing ſo high, that it almoſt blew a Storm; and finding himſelf on the coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> near <hi>Alicant,</hi> both to wait the alteration of the Wind, and to ſuffer the Dutcheſs to refreſh her ſelf on ſhore, he ſtood in, and that Afternoon came to an Anchor about a League above the Town. He landed his fair Theft at a little Village, in a poor Houſe he ſent to provide for their reception; firſt having obliged the Dutcheſs and <hi>Niſe</hi> to change their Cloaths for plainer ones he had provided formerly, himſelf in the habit of an ordinary Seaman, never ſtirring out of their ſight, or from the Door of the Room he kept them ſhut up in, that they might not ſpeak to any body. <hi>Alvaro</hi> had reſted with impatience almoſt a Week in the Village, before the ſtorm had drove him to land was over; when finding the Wind fair for his Voyage to <hi>Majorca,</hi> he brought the Dutcheſs towards Evening from the Houſe he had concealed her in, to oblige her to a ſecond imbarcation; but as he was croſſing the ſtreet of the Village towards the Strand where his Boat was ready to receive them, he was obliged to ſtop a-while to let ſeveral Coaches and Horſemen paſs by, who were going towards <hi>Alicant:</hi> and when he thought all gone, leading the Dutcheſs by force to the place where the Boat lay, juſt as he had lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her into it, a Gentleman, mounted on a graceful <hi>Adaluzian</hi> Horſe, and followed by half a dozen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, came to the Boatſide, and asked with courteſie enough, what ſhip that was lay off, whether they were going on board; but <hi>Alvaro,</hi> either diſdaining an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or fearful of any delay, commanded his men to thruſt out the Boat without taking any notice of the demand was made him; which incivility exaſperating the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman, he drew his Sword, and riding to his Saddle-skirts into the Water cloſe to the Boat, he leapt from his Horſe into it followed by his Servants,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56696:64"/>
telling the Seamen he would by force know, what they denied to his civil requeſt. The inraged Prince and his Company had put themſelves in a poſture of defence, when the afflicted Dutcheſs, whoſe violent grief had made her till then ſilent, riſing from the ſeat ſhe was placed on, Sir (ſaid ſhe to the injured <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>Italian</hi>) if you will do a generous act, let your Sword not only be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to revenge the affront you have received, but to reſcue a miſerable woman from the hands of a wicked raviſher. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> hearing her ſpeak, when he was ready to aſſault thoſe were in the Boat, turned towards her before he preſt any further; and as ſoon as ſhe had deſired his aſſiſtance, without giving any other anſwer than by a reſpectful bow, he turned towards <hi>Alvaro,</hi> ſaying to him; <q>If this Lady be willing to go with you, for her ſake I ſhall forget the rudeneſs you have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards me, but if it is by compulſion you would force her away, I will either redeem her from your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, or reſign my life in the attempt of it;</q> and ending theſe words, he ſtept forward towards the Dutcheſs, who incouraged by his generous declaration, cryed out, <q>'Tis by force, Noble Cavallier, I have been hurried from my own Country, and had rather here end my miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life than remain longer in the power of that unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, is now the diſpoſer of my liberty;</q> If her words were an incouragement to the Stranger to perſiſt in his deſign of freeing her, they were no leſs an incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the violent Prince to get the Boat off by force, ſince he found it would no other way be done, ſo that aſſaulting the young <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and ſeconded by his men, a fierce and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual combat began in the Boat; the Fair Dutcheſs in the mean while, whether frighted by being ſo near the Combatants, or unwilling to loſe ſo fair an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eſcaping from <hi>Alvaro,</hi> leapt from the Boat, almoſt to the ſhoulders in water, and followed by <hi>Niſe,</hi> had
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56696:65"/>
waded to the Shore before ſhe was miſt in the Boat by <hi>Alvaro;</hi> when calling aloud to her Deliverer to quit the diſpute he was ingaged in, to prevent her being forced back by two Seamen followed her from the Boat, ſhe ſaw him throw himſelf into the water; and a great crowd coming down to the ſhore from the Village; <hi>Alvaro</hi> to ſave himſelf from being taken by them, thruſt out to Sea, leaving not only the Princeſs and <hi>Niſe,</hi> but his two men for haſte behind him. As ſoon as he was put off, and the Seamen ſecured by the Company was come in, the valiant <hi>Spaniard,</hi> neither minding, nor in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to purſue him, no other Boat being near, he got ſafe on board, and ſoon after ſailed to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with diſcontent enough to be ſo unexpectedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of what he had adventured ſo much for the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs finding her ſelf at liberty, was about to return thanks to the worthy procurer of it, when the young <hi>Spaniard</hi> addreſſing himſelf to Her and <hi>Niſe;</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes (ſaid he) I muſt needs account my ſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if I have been ſo fortunate to prevent any violence was intended againſt ſo much beauty; and ſince your wet cloaths require you ſhould be conveyed to ſome place where you may change them and repoſe your ſelves, I will adventure to requeſt your acceptance of what convenience my Houſe will afford. To which obliging invitation the Dutcheſs was able to return no anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly ignorant of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language, more than by the affinity it had with her own, partly underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſaid; which being perceived by him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the ſame words in <hi>Italian,</hi> and received an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer full of gratitude from the faireſt Lips in the world. While he was in diſcourſe with her, a Servant told him the Coaches had ſtopt, hearing of the quarrel he was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in, upon which notice, taking the Dutcheſs by the hand, and another Gentleman doing the ſame by <hi>Niſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:56696:65"/>
he deſired they would make uſe of the convenience of them, to be carried to <hi>Alicant,</hi> where he lived. Although the <hi>Italian</hi> Princeſs might have made ſome ſcruples to commit her ſelf to the Charge of a young Man and a Stranger, yet what he had done in her Service, and not knowing how at that time otherwiſe to diſpoſe of her ſelf, ſhe accepted of his Invitation, and was much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it; when coming to one of the Coaches, her Reſcuer committed her to the care of three young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were in it, one of which, he told her was his Wife, but they were prevented from thoſe compliments would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have paſſed between them, by Reaſon they could not underſtand what one another ſaid; and at that time he took no other Care, but to Order they ſhould make what haſte they could to the City, that the ſtrange La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies might be ſhifted from their wet Cloaths. As ſoon as they came to his houſe, he waited on them to a rich apartment, and committed the Care of them to ſeveral young Ladies who could ſcarce without Envy behold their Beauties Eclipſed by her who ſeemed the chief of the two Strangers; that night, being ſupplied with all things neceſſary, ſhe was left with <hi>Niſe</hi> to reſt her ſelf, which ſhe had want enough of, after ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ones as ſhe had ſpent ſince the time ſhe was forced from <hi>Mantua.</hi> The next Morning as ſoon as ſhe was awake, the ſame Company came in to viſit her, and bringing Cloaths for them to put on inſtead of their wet ones; as ſoon as ſhe was ready, her deliverer came to enquire after their Healths; and being invited into her Chamber, after ſeveral Compliments, he begged the Knowledge from her of what Accidents had reduced them to the Reſtraint he found them in; and from the Dutcheſs received a true Account of all her Adventures, only diſguiſing her Quality, by declaring her ſelf the Daughter of a Rich Gentleman of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and her Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher Son to one of equal Conditions. <hi>Felicius</hi> (which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56696:66"/>
was the name of the <hi>Spaneſh</hi> Gentleman) entertained her for ſeveral days with all the reſpect imaginable, till he could procure a ſafe paſſage for her into <hi>Italy;</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, with her permiſſion, not to leave her, till he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her ſafe to her Parents; and he was one After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon ſufficiently ſatisfied with the Reſpects he had ſhewn her, when a Veſſel coming into the Harbour with the <hi>Antiant of Mantua,</hi> as the Dutcheſs with ſeveral La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were walking with him on the Tarras of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which overlookt the Road; She deſired he would ſend a Servant to the Ship, to inquire what News from her Country; and the Perſon that was imployed, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Boat juſt as it Landed; and falling into Diſcourſe with him that ſeemed to Command the reſt, and telling him that he was come from an <hi>Italian</hi> Lady, who deſired to enquire after her Relations in <hi>Mantua,</hi> invited him to his Maſters houſe, which being accepted by the Stranger, he was ſufficiently tranſported with Joy, to find it was the Dutcheſs had ſent for him; and by paying his Duty to her on his Knees, ſurpriſed all the Company was with her, by the conſideration of the greatneſs of her Quality, whom they believed, and had reſpected as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon.</p>
               <p>The ſtranger who was a Nobleman of <hi>Mantua,</hi> by her Command let her know, the great trouble her Subjects were in, for the loſs of her; that he was abroad in the Ship he landed from, to ſearch for her; and that the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> had been at <hi>Majorca,</hi> but was certainly aſſured, that that Prince had never been in the Iſland ſince his Voyage to <hi>Mantua,</hi> although all the Fleet went with him was returned, except the Ship he was in, and that if the Dutcheſs would give him leave to return to Sea, he believed in a day or two he might fall in with the <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Fleet, and bring that King to attend her home. The Princeſs approved very well of his motion, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, after he had by her order repoſed himſelf a while,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56696:66"/>
he imbarqued and ſailed again the ſame Evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Felicius</hi> as ſoon as the Dutcheſs had made an end of ſpeaking with the <hi>Italian</hi> Lord, addreſſing himſelf to her, begged his own Pardon, and that of the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; thet ſhe had not, through their Ignorance, of her Quality: been entertained with that obſervance was due to her Birth and Dignity; which the obliging Princeſs Anſwered, with aſſuring him that he had laid Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on her much greater than ſhe ſhould ever know how to requite; and which ſhe ſhould be forced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by troubling him a few days longer, till the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of thoſe Ships muſt convey her to Italy; <hi>Felicius</hi> not only aſſured her how highly he was honoured in the name of her Hoſt, but having acquainted all his Relations, and the Magiſtrates of <hi>Alicant,</hi> Who reſided in his Houſe; She was viſited, and received the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the conſiderable perſons in the City, having firſt by <hi>Felicius</hi> procurement been furniſhed with Rich Cloaths ſuitable to her State.</p>
               <p>One Evening when moſt of the Company was reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red having before obſerved the great affection of <hi>Felicius</hi> to his Wife, and heard that before his Marriage, many conſiderable Adventures had befallen him, and ſome of thoſe Perſons were in his Houſe; She expreſſed a deſire of being acquainted with them, whoſe Commands her generous Hoſt not willing to diſobey; though he could not hide his diſturbance, at the very thoughts of being to repeat ſo many misfortunes as he had formerly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone; after himſelf, and all the Company had taken ſeats by her Order, making an humble Obeyſance to the Dutcheſs, and directing his Diſcourſe to her in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſhe underſtood, made this following Relation of his Life.</p>

               <p>SInce it is your Highnes's pleaſure to adventure the Trial of your Patience, with the hearing thoſe Troubles ſome part of my Life was attended with, I will begg leave to begin my Story, where I firſt began to feel the Perſecutions of Fortune, which was by the Death of an Indulgent Father; whoſe loſs was no ways compenſated to me, by the enjoyment of a large Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, I ſucceeded him in the Poſſeſſion of; inſomuch that to give more freedome to my melancholy, I removed from the diſturbing noiſe of the City, and retired to a little Country houſe not many Leagues from hence, with no other Company but one Friend called <hi>Alvaro,</hi> and ſuch Servants as were neceſſary for our Attendance; there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying our time, chiefly in the Woods and Fields, where our Guns proved the only Diverſion we either had or ſought after; my Friend indeed had before reſigned his Liberty to the Charms of a young Lady in this City, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Caſſandra;</hi> but to that time, Beauty had rather been unregarded than the occaſion of any diſquiet to my Thoughts; till one day in purſuit of my Game, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened alone into a large Wood, ſome diſtance from my Houſe, and quartering it from one ſide to another, I was brought by a Track to a Brook ſide, which run through the lower parts of it, where going to Refreſh my ſelf with a little water, I ſaw a Woman extended on the Graſs aſleep, whoſe Garb I thought declared her no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the Woods and Fields, her Face being turned
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56696:67"/>
from me, I was about to retire without diſturbing her Reſt, but out of a Curioſity to ſee if her Face was equal to the Excellency of her Shape; I ſtept ſoftly round, where I beheld a Beauty, whoſe Charms without a long Combate, became the full diſpoſers of my Fredome; I ſtood a good while without Motion, contemplating thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections I beheld in her Perſon, till adventuring to kiſs her Hand, as I ſtooped to do it, by Accident my Gun went off as I held it; which haſtily awaking her, in a Fright ſhe ſtarted up and was about to Retire; when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing to lay hold on her Cloaths to ſtop her, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored her Pardon on my Knees, for the diſturbance I had accidentally given her, and the preſumption I ſeemed Guilty of in detaining her till I might hope her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would forgive my Inadvertency; to which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned an obliging Anſwer, and not able to perſwade her from leaving the place ſo ſoon, ſhe haſted out of the Wood, and following her at a little diſtance, I ſaw her enter a Garden belonging to a fair Houſe, adjoyning to the Wood; the Door being immediately ſhut by a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who ſeemed to have waited her coming. I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found my ſelf too much Captivated, to retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther Knowledge of the Perſon had gained ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire a Conqueſt over me; ſo that walking round the Walls of the Garden, I ſaw a Man going towards the Houſe, and asking him whoſe it was, he gave me no little Concern when I heard from him, that it was the Retreat of my greateſt Enemy; for I muſt acquaint your Highneſs, that my Elder Brother in a Duel had Slain a Son of <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> the Father of my adored fair One, who reſolving to admit no Satisfaction without a general Revenge, although my Brother died alſo of his wounds, had withdrawn himſelf and Family, to that ſolitude, till an oppertunity ſhould offer of expreſſing his Reſentment, having declared after he heard of my Fathers Death, that while I lived, there ſtill remained
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56696:68"/>
an Object for his Vengeance, which could not be pacified by all the endeavours of the moſt conſiderable perſons in this City. He had then only one Son living, who was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Court to receive the Order of <hi>Calatrava;</hi> and a Daughter named <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> whom I immediately conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be the Perſon I had lately met with. Full of diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et with the imagination of my perverſe Fortune, I went back into the Wood, and not long after, meeting <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> I gave him an account of my Adventure, and alſo of the irreſiſtableneſs of the Paſſion ſhe had inſpired me with. He was ſo wiſe to perſwade me with ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to deſiſt from a pretenſion I could never hope to ſucceed in; and what would prove moſt dangerous to my Life if purſued. But I found Love had inflamed me with ſo violent a deſire of obtaining what I wiſht to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, that all his perſwaſions to the contrary, were but as ſo many incouragements to me to proceed in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; then it was I began to feel the effects my new Paſſion wrought in me: I found it work with a violent force on my Senſes, ſometimes flattering my Soul with imagined Tranſports; then growing more calm, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wrap me in a Lethergy of ſo much forgetfulneſs, that I ceaſed to be any longer Maſter of my Reaſon, but inclined to meet it as an eaſie Death, from an inſinuating Tyrant; this unintelligable effect, which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the diſtraction of the wiſeſt; compelled me to diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Councel of my prudent Friend, who after ſome days finding my reſolutions unalterable, promiſed me his utmoſt Aſſiſtance; and for ſeveral nights bore me Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to the Walls of my Enemies houſe, which incloſed her to whom I was far from being one; where in a kind of Serenade, I ſung my griefs under the Windows on that ſide of the Houſe, I had learnt was her Apartment; this Courſe we followed ſeveral nights, till at laſt being taken notice of, I had a caution brought me as we ſtood under the window, by a Villager as I gueſt him, that one who
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56696:68"/>
did not hate me, adviſed, I ſhould avoid the expoſing my Life to ſo imminent danger, as that place threatned me with; although I could not gueſs from whom the Meſſage ſhould come, for that time I obſerved the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was given me, and retired, not being able to learn any thing more from the perſon had brought it. But a day or two after, reſolving to find ſome way of letting <hi>Narciſa</hi> know more plainly my Love. In the diſguiſe of a Peaſant I came a little before Sunſet to the Garden, where perceiving the Door half open, and adventuring to look in, I was ſo fortunate to behold my fair Miſtriſs ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the ſide of a Fountain with a Maid by her; and <hi>Leriano</hi> whom I knew to be her Kinſman; I had waited but a little while, delighted with the admiration of her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when I ſaw her riſe, and walking alone through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Allies in the Garden, came at laſt cloſe to the Door where I ſtood, and adventuring within it, I gave her a Letter I had provided, telling her, it was from her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Celauro.</hi> She had ſcarce taken the Paper from me, when I perceived by her Bluſhes, and the diſorder ſhe ſeemed to be in, that I was known to her; but juſt as I was about to ſpeak, her Couſen coming that way after her, I was forced to retire from the Garden, and thence entring the Wood where <hi>Alauro</hi> had waited for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, I gave him an Account of my ſucceſs. After that day I had the oportunity of ſeeing her ſeveral others at the Chappel of a Village not far from her Fathers houſe, always concealing my ſelf in a ruſtick Diſguiſe, however not unknown to her, from whom I ſeldome wanted the ſatisfaction of a ſmile, it being impoſſible for me to ſpeak to her, <hi>Don Fernando</hi> being always in ſight; but upon what occaſion I could then by no means know, ſhe was kept ſhut up within her houſe, for near two Months without my being able to ſee her; which afterwards I learnt was through her Fathers jealouſie finding ſhe took more freedome among the innocent Villagers than his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56696:69"/>
ſcrupulous diſpoſition would allow; upon ſo long a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation from her Sight, I grew ſo Melancholy that overperſwaded by my friend, I removed to ſeek ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in this City, whether I was no ſooner come, but my Anxiety was increaſed, by an Information I received that <hi>Lariano,</hi> who as a Kinſman, was received in her Fathers houſe, had declared himſelf her Servant; and as was believed, would by her Father be admitted, to a nearer Alliance; and as an aggravation of this diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, it was added to me that <hi>Celauro</hi> her Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned ſuccesful from Court, reſided in this City, not only enquiring after me, as an Enemy, but as was believed he had heard ſomething of my aſſiduity about his Fathers Country-houſe in Diſguiſe; theſe concerns joyned to the impoſſibility I thought there was of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuccesful in my Love, had almoſt brought me to a reſolution of quitting the City again, and ſpending ſome time in Travel, to ſeek by abſence a Cure for my Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when Fortune was pleaſed ſtrangely to confirm me in a Reſolution of indulging my Paſſion.</p>
               <p>My Friend <hi>Alvaro,</hi> for whoſe ſake I was contented to ſtay ſome days in Town, at that time was happy in the Favours of his Miſtriſs <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> whom ſometimes viſiting by night, I remained his Centinel in the Street either to prevent, or adviſe him of any approaching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſeveral nights I had obſerved a Man hid in his Cloak paſs by me, with more Curioſity than I could well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of; though I ſtill let him alone, to avoid the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance a Street-quarrel might give my Friend and his Miſtriſs; till at laſt grown weary of the obſervance he took of me, I went towards him, who coming forwards to meet me; Cavalier (ſaid he, without giving me time to ſpeak) if you have no buſineſs in this Street where I ſee you often unimployed, you will do well not to be a hinderance of anothers Deſign, wherefore I deſire you to quit it either in Curteſy, or by Neceſſity. Did not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56696:69"/>
Neceſſity require my Preſence (ſaid I) in Curteſie I might perhaps be induced to Retire, but am not to be frighted from a place I have once fixt my ſelf in; Then you muſt be beaten out, (replied he) at the ſame time directing his Sword to my Breaſt, but receiving his Thruſt upon a Buckler I held out, mine proved ſo Fatal as to lay him dead at my Feet; whereupon finding the danger I was in, and ſeeing People approach from all Parts, upon hearing the Cries of my wounded Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary before he Expired; I haſted as faſt as I could, out of the Street, at the end of which, ſeeing ſome Officers enter, I was forced to turn, not able to imagine any way whereby I might eſcape; till coming cloſe to the Wall of a Garden took up one part of the Street, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome difficulty I climbed to the top of it, and Leaped down into the Garden, reſolving to conceal my ſelf there, till the Buſtle in the Street was over; in the mean time, walking along one of the Allies, at the end of it I diſcovered a Light in a low Window, which coming nearer, I found was that of a ſmall Summer-houſe, at the bottom of a Walk of Orange Trees; going ſoftly toward it, and the Caſement being open, I perceived a Woman leaning on the Table, with a written Paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, which after fetching a Sigh or two ſhe read ſo as I could overhear words to this effect:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Morning, my Brother coming to our Lodg, prevailed with my Father to let me bear Eſtella Company, while the Solemnity laſts; She will deliver this Paper to you, and if poſſible, contrive ſome way for our having an Enterview, when you will have the ſatisfaction, if it prove one to you, to know you are not hated by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Juſt as ſhe had made an end of Reading her Paper, riſing up, by a glance of her Face, I was ſurprized, to ſee my ſelf ſo near my adored <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> but preſently the Jealouſie of thinking the Paper ſhe had wrote, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſome more happy Lover than my Self, not able
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56696:70"/>
longer to be ſilent; Is it poſſible Madam (ſaid I) that the ſincereſt Paſſion in the World is deſpiſed by you? She was too much ſurpriſed at the Sight of me in that place, to be able to return a word in Anſwer to my Complaint; but having recollected her ſelf, after giving me leave to expreſs my Love with all the endearment I could. Had my Thoughts (ſaid ſhe) been as indifferent towards you, as you imagine they are, I had perhaps been free from the diſquiets I have but too often met with ſince I ſaw you in the Wood; yet do not preſume too much upon the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of my Confeſſion, that I never beheld a Man I could allow more worthy than <hi>Felicius;</hi> the Reſtraint I live in, may partly excuſe the owning what is no more than a juſt return to the firmneſs of your Love. And the Note you ſee here, was deſigned for no other but your ſelf, to let you know of my being in the City: it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to expreſs the Joy her words infuſed in me; but not giving me leave ſcarce to ſpeak, ſhe was earneſt of knowing how I came into the Garden. I told her of the Accident had made me ſeek ſhelter there, ſo that unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to expoſe me to the danger, I was threatned with in the Street, She at laſt was perſwaded to conceal me in a Cloſet near her Chamber; but as I was following her to it, we were ſuſpended by a great Noiſe and Buſtle in the Houſe; and hearing it was made by the Officers who came in ſearch of me, not adventuring to let me go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Houſe, by her direction I ſtept into a little Room near the Garden Door, which ſhe Lock'd upon me and went away to learn the occaſion of the Families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up again. I continued there two hours without the return of my Miſtriſs, which began to Create new Fears in me. So that I reſolved to go out and make my eſcape the way I had come in; but feeling in the dark for the Door, I met with one that had a Spring-Lock which opened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Room of the Houſe, and adventuring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into it, ſeeing the Reflexion of a dim Light
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56696:70"/>
thorow the Crannies of another Door; I opened it ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and was amazed to behold in the middle of a large Hall, the Corps of a Man laid out, with the <hi>Mantle of the Order of Calatrava</hi> upon him. I was doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould be <hi>Celauro,</hi> or <hi>Eſtella</hi>'s Brother (both being Knights of the ſame Habit) whoſe houſe I had learned from <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> it was ſhe reſided then in. As I was ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in that ſuſpence, this ſtrange Accident had put me in, I ſaw a Woman Lighting <hi>Narciſſa</hi> and <hi>Eſtella</hi> into the Hall, ſo that fearful of being ſeen, I made a ſhift to get back to my Priſon, and ſhut my ſelf up, not being able to open the Door I came firſt in at, that I might have eſcaped thorow the garden. The remainder of the Night, and all the next Morning, I continued in my Confinement, more fearful of occaſioning any Blemiſh to <hi>Narciſſa's</hi> Honour, by my appearance, than out of any apprehenſion of the Danger my Life might be expoſed to in the houſe of an Enemy; but about Noon all the Doubts my mind was Agitated with, were removed, by ſeeing my Miſtriſs enter the Room, and ſhutting the Door upon her, after having ſome time given way to her Tears. <q>Ah <hi>Felicius</hi> (ſaid ſhe to me) how unlucky has your Hand been, in proving the Occaſion of that Grief fills the Houſe we are in; <hi>Eſtela</hi>'s Brother is dead, and was brought in laſt night from the place where you told me a Man had fallen by your Sword; the Officers of Juſtice have been ever ſince in Search of his Murderer, which as hitherto I muſt hope will continue unſucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for my Brother has ſo devoted himſelf to Revenge his Death, that ſhould You be known for the Author of it, the Animoſities of our Families would be renewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and I muſt certainly for ever looſe one I cannot hate.</q> Her grief would let her ſay no more, and I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſpel it with all the Arguments I could, ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vowing, to imploy the Life ſhe preſerved from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of her Friends, in a perpetual Adoration of her;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56696:71"/>
which Aſſurance ſhe requited, in letting me know, Love had taken no weak poſſeſſion of her Breaſt, and that I could no way oblige her more, than in being careful of a Life was more than indifferent to her; in Order to which ſhe reſolved I ſhould continue where I was till Night, and then adviſed me for ſome time to leave the City, I having not appeared publickly in it for many days before; and having given me ſome Fruit ſhe brought with her, left me till an hour within night, when bearing me Company to the farther ſide of the Garden, our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion likely to be long, was ſufficiently afflictive.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I found my ſelf at Liberty, without farther delay, I left the City, and by Day-break reached my Country-houſe in <hi>Peniaflor,</hi> having walked five Leagues that Night; my Friend <hi>Alvaro</hi> was got thither before me, who told me, that hearing the noiſe in the ſtreet was made upon the unhappy young Mans Death, whom he concluded I had killed; and fearing if the adjacent houſes ſhould be ſearch'd for the Murderer, his Miſtris's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be as much endangered as his own Perſon, he went out into the Street, and getting ſafe by the Crowd called at my houſe, but learning nothing of me, he took Horſe and came to my Country-houſe hoping to find me, having left his Servant <hi>Liſardo</hi> behind to bring us word the next day what was diſcourſed in the City about the Nights Rancounter. But ſeveral days paſt without our receiving any conſiderable Information, and growing impatient, as <hi>Alvaro</hi> was to ſee <hi>Caſſandra</hi> who had ſent for him, he went back to <hi>Alicant</hi> to make her a Viſit, and returning two days after, I learnt from him, that my Miſtriſs was with all her Fathers Family, at their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Houſe; but were very ſuddenly to remove to a houſe he had newly bought in the City. The ſame Evening, no longer able to brook my tedious deprivation from her, with <hi>Alvaro</hi> only in my Company we Rode to the Wood where I had firſt ſeen her, and having aſſumed my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56696:71"/>
ruſtick Diſguiſe; while my Friend ſtayed with our Horſes, I went towards <hi>Don Fernando</hi>'s Lodge, and a little from the Gate of it, ſaw her walking with her Brother and ſeveral other Gentlemen, leaning on the Arm of her beloved Couſin <hi>Eſtela.</hi> Although I was careful of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching too near them, my adored <hi>Narciſſa</hi> ſoon knew me, and as I gueſſed by her Direction, <hi>Eſtela</hi> coming from her towards me; Shepheard (ſaid ſhe with a low Voice) the loſt Lamb you ſeek may be found near the Garden-door about Midnight; and immediately turning back to her Company, I careleſly withdrew; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Alvaro</hi> in the Wood where I left him, gave him an Account of my Fortune. And reſting our ſelves under a Tree, till the time was appointed by <hi>Eſtela,</hi> we went together towards the Lodg, leaving our Horſes tied in a private place; as ſoon as I came to the Garden Door, finding it open, juſt as I ſtept in, my Miſtriſs and <hi>Eſtela</hi> met me; who withdrawing a little way from us, gave me all the freedome I could deſire of aſſuring <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> that nothing but an inſupportable Abſence from her, could be an affliction to me: her kindneſs I found was not at all leſſened by it; and before we parted, I learn'd from her, that a Marriage was ſuddenly deſign'd between her Brother <hi>Celauro</hi> and <hi>Eſtela;</hi> in Order to which, her Father was removing to live in <hi>Alicant;</hi> and withal, that what I feared of her being deſigned for <hi>Leri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> was come to nothing, but that we were to expect more trouble how to diſappoint <hi>Grotillus,</hi> a worthy young Gentleman, whoſe Addreſſes could not be more rejected by her, than they were approved of by old <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando;</hi> however, to prevent ſo long an abſence for the future, and that we might at leiſure conſult about the management of our Affairs, ſhe promiſed me to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an acquaintance with <hi>Caſſandra, Alvaro</hi>'s Miſtriſs, and by her to let me know how I ſhould come to the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56696:72"/>
Speech of her when in <hi>Alicant;</hi> and telling me <hi>Eſtela</hi> was ignorant ſtill of her Brothers Murderer, ſhe brought me to her, who promiſed the utmoſt of her Aſſiſtance, to procure by our Marriage, the Concluſion of that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity had ſo long continued between our Families; I expreſſed my Paſſion to One, and Acknowledgments to the Other, with all the endearment I could; when called away by the Mornings Approach, we took leave of one another, till we ſhould meet the week following in <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant;</hi> and finding my Friend a little without the Door, we returned to our Horſes, and ſo back again to <hi>Peniaflor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The week after, being removed to Town, I accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied my Friend in a Viſit he made to <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> who had expreſſed to him in a Letter a deſire of ſeeing me, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the neceſſary Compliments, ſhe gave me an Account of her having viſited <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> who promiſed to return it in two days, when ſhe deſired me to come with <hi>Alvaro,</hi> that I might have the opportunity of ſeeing her; I was very punctual at the time, and enjoyed all the freedome of Diſcourſe I could wiſh, having prevailed ſo far with my Charming Miſtriſs, that promiſing a ſecond Viſit the week following, ſhe conſented I ſhould procure a Prieſt privatly to contract us, which I urged as the only ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could be given me againſt <hi>Grotillus</hi>'s Pretenſion; which accordingly being done, I received from her a Maſter-key, which gave me entrance, not only into her Fathers Garden, but to all parts of the Houſe. I made Uſe of it ſeveral times, having learn'd the way to her Chamber, where our mutual Satisfaction was too great to laſt long undiſturb'd; although to ſecure it, I had writ to the Counteſs <hi>Policena</hi> (a Widow, whoſe Title and Eſtate I was not only Heir to, but was always loved by her as an only Son) giving her an Account of my <hi>Amours,</hi> and that I reſolved to ſhelter my ſelf and Wife in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> under her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56696:72"/>
till a Reconcilement could be procured with <hi>Narciſſa</hi>'s Relations, which ſhe ſo willingly conſented to, that we had fixt a day for our departure, when the moſt unheard of accident in the world befell us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leriano,</hi> who once hoped to be the Husband of <hi>Narciſſa</hi> finding himſelf neglected by Don <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who preferred <hi>Grotillus</hi> before him, pretended out of diſcontent, a Voyage to <hi>Italy,</hi> which every one believed he had undertaken; while in reality he remained concealed in <hi>Alicant.</hi> But the Night before that of our intended flight, having conveigh'd my ſelf privately to my <hi>Narciſſa's</hi> Chamber, we were ſo long debating which way our Removal might be effected with moſt ſecurity, that at laſt tired with a diſcourſe gave her ſo many apprehenſions, ſhe fell aſleep on the Bed as I was ſitting by her; but had repoſed a very little while, when I heard the door of the Chamber ſoftly opened; I ſtarted immediately up from the Bed, and ſtepping round it, placed my ſelf at the Door I uſed to go down to the Garden by, reſolving before I went away, to liſten, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I might learn, who viſited my Wife at ſuch unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hours. I heard the ſteps move towards the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, juſt as <hi>Narciſſa</hi> waking and miſſing me; where are you my Lord <hi>Felicius</hi> (ſaid ſhe?) I am not <hi>Felicius,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Maid, (anſwered the diſturber of our quiet) I am none of that happy man, makes your very dreams delightful, but the moſt miſerable one upon earth; one, your beauty has raiſed to ſo violent a Tranſport, that I have entred this Room with a determination of leaving you before I quit it, either enjoyed or dead. I am doubtful which of us was moſt amazed at the hearing ſuch a vile declaration, but while my diſorder kept me immoveable, who are you wicked Villain (replied <hi>Narciſſa</hi>) that durſt profane this place with your preſence, or my Ears with the mention of ſuch curſed reſolutions; but retire quickly, or my Cries ſhall bring that death you threaten, on your own
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56696:73"/>
Head. Lovely Enemy (anſwered he, as I gueſſed lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on her) in vain you deny that to my Entreaty, which my Force will accompliſh. Looſe me Traytor (ſaid ſhe aloud) and throwing her ſelf from the Bed, paſt juſt by the place where I ſtood, my Enemy ſtill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hold of her; whom diſcerning by that little light the Stars afforded through the Window, I broke his hold, by two or three ſtabs I gave him in the Breaſt with my Dagger, who falling at my feet, cried out, Oh <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> You and my love have ſlain me. I called pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to her, but received no Anſwer, and conſidering the danger would attend my ſtay till <hi>Don Fernando</hi> and his Family were up, I haſted down Stairs to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the way I had come in at; but to add to my diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance found the Door ſhut, and a Key left in the Lock on the other ſide, ſo that mine would ſtand me in no ſtead. I ran up Stairs again to find <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> who I thought might convey me out another way, but could meet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but freſh diſorders; for by the Cries of the man I had wounded, the whole Family was alarmed, and I heard people haſting to the Room where I thought my ſelf confined; believing then I muſt of neceſſity fall a Victim to the fury of <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> I grew to ſo high a pitch of Deſpair, that rather than fall into the hands of him and his Son, I ſtept to a Balcon Window of the Room, juſt as they were entring at the Door, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of throwing my ſelf precipitately from it; but as I laid hold of the Rail to leap over, I hapned to meet with the hook of a Silk-ladder hung down to the Garden; although I loſt no time in making Uſe of ſo opportune a convenience to eſcape, I could not be ſo ſudden but that <hi>Ferdinando</hi> entred the Room with his Son and Servants, and perceiving me, made ſeveral ſhots at me; however I reached ſafe to the ground, when I found my ſelf aſſaulted by two men, from whom I was

forced to retire, having no Sword to defend my ſelf, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Buckler which received the thruſts were made at me, and a Piſtol, which being perceived in my hand by a Dark-lanthorn one of them held, made them cautious in preſſing too earneſtly upon me; while I retired with all the haſt I could to the Garden-door, by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune I found it open, and as I went out, firing my Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, it gave them ſo much diſturbance, that I had time to make a ſafe Retreat whither I would, though not without ſome wounds. I went directly to the Houſe of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> the Father of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> my Friend <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s Miſtreſs, who received me with much kindneſs, and the aſſurance that I ſhould remain ſafe and concealed while any danger threatned me; and during the time I continued ſo in <hi>Don Pedro's</hi> Houſe, my wounds were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, and I learned that after <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> had ſeen the deſperate way I took for my eſcape, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of his Servants to go down and purſue me, he himſelf turned back into the room, called by the groans of the man I left wounded, whom he found to be <hi>Leri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi> my Wives Kinſman. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> perceiving him ſtill able to ſpeak, inquired how he came thither, and in that condition; to which he anſwered, that having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for a Husband to <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> he pretended to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, but lying concealed ſtill in <hi>Alicant,</hi> he procured ſuch falſe Keys as gave him entrance to the Garden, from whence he had climbed up to her Chamber by a ſilk Ladder, fixt to the barrs of her Window, reſolving ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Perſwaſion, or Force to enjoy her, thereby aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured he ſhould diſappoint the hopes of his Rival <hi>Grotil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> but that ſurprizing her in her Bed and aſleep, upon her waking ſhe called out to <hi>Felicius,</hi> whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, being then with her, had given him thoſe wounds would end his unfortunate life, and begging their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of a crime he muſt expiate with it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56696:74"/>
it with the blood iſſued from his wounds; and ſcarce had he breathed his laſt, when they were diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a freſh aggravation to their trouble, which was, that <hi>Narciſſa</hi> could not be found in the Houſe: while they were in this confuſion, <hi>Grotillus</hi> came in, who being informed of what <hi>Leriano</hi> had declared before his death, told them that himſelf had ſeen me ſeveral Nights about the Houſe, and determining to find out the cauſe of my aſſiduity, was then in the ſtreet watching about the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-wall, and had a little before diſcovered ſome body come out, who fled with ſo much haſte, that he could not poſſibly diſcover who it was; but returning to the Garden door, and finding it open, he heard a noiſe in the Houſe, and at the ſame time diſcerned a man come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down (by a Ladder, as he gueſſed) from the Balcon, whom he purpoſed to apprehend, but purſuing him to the Street-door, his Man was ſhot by him, and he made his Eſcape. By what <hi>Grotillus</hi> declared, and my Cloak being found in the room, they were confirmed that I was the murderer of <hi>Leriano,</hi> but the next day, and ſeveral after, if they were buſie in ſearching for me, aſſiſted by the Officers of Juſtice: I was not leſs perplexed at the information I received, that <hi>Narciſſa</hi> could no where be heard of, and all the diligence of a ſtrict Search they made through the whole City proved ineffectual towards the finding of her. At the firſt hearing of it I was glad of her Eſcape, fearing her Fathers rigour; but when a careful and private inquiry I made my ſelf for ſeveral days, gave me as little ſatisfaction as <hi>Don Fernando</hi> had received, It is not eaſie to expreſs the ſorrow I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for her abſence; which, at that time (being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to troubles) was aggravated by the intelligence I had from <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> that my Friend <hi>Alvaro</hi> had been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ever ſince the fatal night of our miſeries; and that both his neareſt Friends and Servants were wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56696:74"/>
of the Cauſe of his retirement, or the Place of it. I muſt confeſs that my firſt apprehenſions were apt to impute his departure to cowardiſe; which his fair Miſtreſs joyned with me alſo in, taxing him with want of affection, to leave her ſo abruptly without making her the confident of his deſign, or writing a word to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it ever ſince his departure. But ſome days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all our doubts were removed by a Letter <hi>Liſardo</hi> brought me from the Counteſs <hi>Policena,</hi> (to whom I had wrote an account of my cruel diſaſter,) by which I underſtood that my adored <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> attended by <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> was arrived ſafe at her Houſe; and the reaſon why I knew not of it ſooner, was, that ſhe was ignorant where I had concealed my ſelf, to write with ſafety to me; but truſting to <hi>Liſardo's</hi> fidelity, had ſent him to deſire I would without delay haſten my journey thither. This joyful news was too pleaſing to let me demur in the leaſt what I ſhould reſolve on; ſo that however ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the diligence of revengeful Enemies to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover me, I took leave of <hi>Caſſandra</hi> the ſame Night, and in the diſguiſe of a Peaſant, (ordering <hi>Liſardo</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main behind for an Intelligencer) I travelled by Night, lying private all day, without adventuring into any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick houſe, to avoid diſcovery; and after having been three Nights on the road, grown weary with the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſo diſorderly a journey, I went a little diſtance from the track, and tying my Horſe to a Tree, laid my ſelf down under another, to take ſome reſt; where, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the afflicting thoughts of the troubles had ſo lately aſſaulted me, I fell aſleep, but was ſoon awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a ſudden noiſe I heard juſt by me, and riſing haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up, I perceived by my ſide, a man extended on the earth; but not finding him ſtir, I ſtooped to raiſe him up, when I ſoon diſcerned he had reſigned his life to ſome wounds (as I judged by the heat was ſtill in him) he had
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56696:75"/>
newly received. Immediately I liſtned to hear if there was any body thereabouts who had been the Author of ſo unexpected a Tragedy; but not perceiving any other noiſe than what the Wind made among the Leaves of the Trees, I walked ſoftly a foot down towards the Road, where I diſcerned a Coach, and drawing near it, found the Horſes hamſtring'd, and no body in it, which made me apprehend there had been greater violences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than that of the ſlain man under the Tree; and hearkning again with attention, I fancied to hear a noiſe like people diſcourſing a little diſtance from the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I walked ſoftly towards the place from whence the noiſe came, and ſheltred by the Nights obſcurity, got undiſcerned ſo near as to hear one ſay; <q>
                     <hi>Alvaro Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> muſt pardon this error of my choler, which I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined was not without juſtice: but if apprehended otherwiſe, I am willing <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, whoſe Beauty was the ſole occaſion of this misfortune. Your miſtake <hi>Grotillus (anſwered one, who by the voice I knew to be a woman)</hi> was founded on the affinity of two names, and be aſſured the reſentment I have expreſt muſt needs ceaſe to condemn you, when I am ſatisfied, that, not only the height of Love, but purſuit of a juſt Revenge made you act towards me what you did, believing your Couſin <hi>Narciſſa</hi> was in the Coach, guarded by your Enemies Friends.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When I had overheard thus much, believing it a fooliſh temerity to ſtay longer, ſo ill provided as I was, near a declared enemy, I returned ſoftly back to the place where I had left my Horſe; and proſecuting my journey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſturbance, arrived the following Evening ſafe at <hi>Valentia.</hi> The Noble and Charitable Counteſs recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me with an affectionate Welcome, but when I inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> ſhe declared to know nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her, than what my Letter had given intelligence
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56696:75"/>
of. At firſt, I believed ſhe only denied her in jeſt, to give ſome allay to the joy I had expreſt of being ſo near her; and to remove the doubt, I ſhewed her the Letter wherein ſhe ſummoned me to <hi>Valentia,</hi> but ſhe convinced me her character had been counterfeited in it, which ſo much afflicted me, that the very violence I did my ſelf reduced me to a Fever, which I ſtruggled with ſeveral days. On one when I began to mend, (during my ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs having been attended as if an only Son to the Counteſs) a Page acquainted me, that a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a ſtranger, deſired to ſpeak with me; I ordered him to be brought in, who after the uſual complements, inquired of me what was become of <hi>Alvaro</hi> and <hi>Narciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa;</hi> and being informed that neither of them was, or had been in <hi>Valentia,</hi> fetching a deep ſigh he ſwounded away by my Bedſide: I called immediately for ſomebody to his aſſiſtance, and by that time they had brought him to himſelf again, looking heedfully on his face I knew the diſguiſed Youth to be <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> my Friends Miſtreſs: and being perfectly recovered, when the Company was retired, after having given her an account of my Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſince I left <hi>Alicant,</hi> ſhe requited it by telling me; That the ſatisfaction ſhe received by underſtanding from the Counteſſes Letter, of <hi>Alvaro's</hi> being ſafe at <hi>Valentia,</hi> was converted to the higheſt affliction, by a declaration ſhe had from her Father, (inſtigated thereto by <hi>Eſtefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> her rigid Mother-in-Law) that in two days ſhe muſt reſolve to marry <hi>Mauritio,</hi> who had long pretended to her, or profeſs her ſelf a Nun in what Covent ſhe ſhould make choice of. This reſolution of her Parents obliged her to as haſty a determination to prevent it, which all other ways appearing impoſſible, and overcome by her love to <hi>Alvaro,</hi> ſhe had in a diſguiſe left both her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe and Countrey; and believing to find <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> with the Counteſs, had adventured in Boys Cloaths
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56696:76"/>
on ſo long a journey, to be protected by him from her Fathers threatned violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I had travelled <hi>(ſaid ſhe to me, in continuing her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)</hi> ſome days, when towards evening withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an Inn in a ſmall Town to paſs the Night, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got a Room the fartheſt from thoſe were taken up by ſome Company in the Houſe, there came to the ſame place a Coach and ſix Horſes, out of which alighted a young Gentleman and two Women, one of which by the richneſs of her Garb ſeemed to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on by the other, and coming all up Stairs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the very Room I was retired to, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deſiring me in courteſie to reſign it to the Lady was with him, there being no other convenient one in the Houſe empty, which I ſeemed very willing to do, but deſired I might not be expoſed to the notice of any body in the Houſe, it importing me much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. And the Gentleman taking ſome perticular obſervation of me, after ſeveral diſcourſes, having upon his Inquiry told him of what place I was, he asked me if I had any acquaintance with <hi>Alvaro Prada,</hi> I anſwered, that I not only knew him very well, but was his Servant, and then travelled towards <hi>Valentia</hi> to meet him. He was very glad at what I ſaid, and aſſured me he was a moſt particular Friend to my <hi>Alvaro,</hi> both having been formerly Students to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Univerſity of <hi>Valliadolid;</hi> the intimacy being contracted firſt between them on occaſion of the affinity of their Names, he being called <hi>Alvaro Felix;</hi> and then on a journey to <hi>Valentia</hi> with his Wife, who was the Lady I ſaw with him, called <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the next day they obliged me to bear them company in their Coach to <hi>Valentia;</hi> I muſt confeſs to you, that not only the extraordinary Beauty but the ſhape and complection of the Lady were ſo conformable to that of <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> I
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56696:76"/>
could ſcarce be ſatisfied within my ſelf but ſhe was the fair Companion I had met with, which <hi>Alvaro Felix</hi> half confirmed to me, by intimating that he was fully acquainted with the Adventures of <hi>Felicius.</hi> As we were travelling on the Road, they took more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice of me than they had done before, obſerving, as I gueſſed, my complection to be fairer than is uſual with men; but whoſe notice I perceived to be greateſt, was that of <hi>Jacinto,</hi> a ſervant of <hi>Alvaro's,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be indiſpoſed, they had taken into the Coach with us, to make his journey more eaſie than it would have been on his Horſe. We travelled all day, reſting only a little at Noon to refreſh the Horſes; and about Sunſet, the evening being very clear, <hi>Alvaro</hi> and his Lady alighted out of the Coach, and we all refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves with what they had provided the Night before: after which <hi>Iſabella</hi> and her Husband returning to the Coach, deſired I would walk ſoftly after it awhile with <hi>Jacinto,</hi> which we did till the Night began to grow upon us, her Woman remaining with them in the Coach. As we went ſoftly on together <hi>Jacinto</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me with a relation of the quality of his Maſter, who he told me was a <hi>Sevilian</hi> born, and then going with his Wife to viſit her Friends in <hi>Valentia;</hi> but from that he fell into a Diſcourſe much leſs agreeable to me, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me how like I was to a young Woman he had long ſince applied his Addreſſes to. While I was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by him with the entertainment of hearing his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures with his Miſtreſs (which at length I began to be pleaſed with) ſuppoſing he did not in the leaſt doubt but I was a man, we quite loſt ſight of the Coach, and ſoon after it was out of hearing, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to diſturb me, withal perceiving we had quite left the Road, I ſtopt, telling him I would go no farther that way he led me; but being deceived by his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56696:77"/>
urging he knew where we were very well, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing that little Track we were in, it would bring us before the Coach to a Country Houſe they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity paſs by; I not only yielded to his deſire in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, but having climbed with ſome difficulty up a rocky Hill, at his requeſt ſat down with him to reſt our ſelves; when taking me faſt by the hand he told me I muſt no longer deceive him with the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitious name of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> ſince he was fully convinced he had a <hi>Leonarda</hi> in his company; at firſt I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſmiling at his words to make a jeſt of the miſtake I told him my tender Years had occaſioned; but he not ſatisfied therewith, proceeding from Argument to Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, attempting to diſcover by force what I was ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of concealing; at laſt in ſpight of my reſiſtance, threw me all along on the ground, and as I was ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him, 'tis true ſaid he, my conjecture is true, and now my Coy Miſtriſs is in the power of her Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; juſt as he uttered thoſe words, and when I thought all my Reſiſtance would prove ineffectual to the preſervation of my Honour, by chance I laid my hand on the Hilt of a Dagger he had by his Side, and and having no other remedy to ſave my ſelf by, I drew it, and with two Stabs in his Side, made him deſiſt from his wicked Deſign; I got up immediately and fled from ſo fatal a place, leaving the raſh young Man Groaning on the Earth, which by what you have related to me, I gueſs was at the ſame time you was retired into that Mountain; and he had ſtrength enough to go ſo far as to die near the place you was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in, which occaſioned your meeting afterwards with <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Coach, and learned abruptly the deſign of <hi>Grotillus,</hi> but how they were reduced to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you found them in, I am wholly ignorant of; for, travelling alone all that night, without hearing more of them, I got ſafe hither.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56696:77"/>This Account I received from <hi>Caſſandra</hi> of her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, extolling her Courage in the ſafeguard of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. A day or two after <hi>Caſſandra</hi>'s coming to the Counteſſes houſe, I received News from <hi>Liſardo,</hi> that <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſa</hi> was ſuppoſed to remain Concealed in her Fathers Houſe; and ſoon after recovering perfectly my Health, I left <hi>Valentia,</hi> in ſearch of my Friend <hi>Alvaro,</hi> whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be the Author of that Counterfeit Letter had brought me thither, and hoping to find him ſomewhere about <hi>Alicant,</hi> I went directly to <hi>Denia</hi> where I heard ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies lay, which were to touch at that place in their Voyage thorow the <hi>Straits;</hi> but though my ill Fortune brought me thither two days after they Sailed; upon Inquiry in the Town I learned ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which induced me to believe one of the Gallies carried my Friend and a Lady in his Company to <hi>Sevil.</hi> Upon this Intelligence, and being diſappointed of a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by Sea, I returned again to <hi>Valentia,</hi> and gave <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra</hi> an Account of what I had heard, who underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my Reſolution of going to <hi>Sevil,</hi> not only to find <hi>Alvaro,</hi> but to keep as far as I could from <hi>Alicant,</hi> where I was informed my Enemies lay, in continual watch to deſtroy me; contrary to the Intreaties and perſwaſions both of the Counteſs and my ſelf, She would bear me Company in my Journey, which I feared to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe too much, leſt as ſoon as I was gone, ſhe ſhould make ſuch another Venture as ſhe had from <hi>Alicant.</hi> And not long after, having word ſent me that ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels were Arrived at <hi>Denia,</hi> bound to St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> I took my leave of the <hi>Noble Policena,</hi> and having <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra</hi> with me in her Boys Cloaths, we went on Board, and the Wind being fair, as ſoon as our Captain had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſome Freſh Water, which he chiefly ſtopt there for, we ſet Sail, making the beſt of our way towards the <hi>Straits</hi> Mouth.

We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued eight and forty hours ſtruggling with the mercileſs Seas and Winds, at the end of which, no longer able to reſiſt the impetuoſity of the Storm, our Leaky Ship was daſhed in pieces againſt a Rock not far from the Shore, when by the help of a broken planck, I ſwam to Land, but ſcarce had ſet footing on it, and a little recollected my ſelf from the diſturbance of having been ſo lately Shipwrackt; when looking haſtily about to ſee from what part ſeveral Arquebuſſes were ſhot, which I heard, I ſaw a Man rolling down from the Top of a high Hill, whoſe Steepneſs made it want little of a Precipice; and going towards him, when he was quite at the Bottom, I found his Spirits diſmaid, through the violent blows he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Fall. The Compaſſion I took of him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by his Garb he was none of inferiour Rank,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56696:78"/>
made me careful to find if he had any Life remaining; and unbuttoning his Coat to give more freedome to his Breath, in a ſhort time he began to ſtir; but how much was I ſurpriſed upon opening his Boſome, to find hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Scarlet Ribon the Order of <hi>Saint James,</hi> and with it the Picture of my adored <hi>Narciſſa;</hi> what my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance was at ſo unexpected a Sight, may eaſily be gueſſed, and the weight of my Grief was ſo violent to find another poſſeſſed of any thing related to her, that (over-weak before with ſwimming, and wanting ſtrength to reſiſt that laſt Aſſault of Fortune,) I fell down in a Swoon, by his Side I had been endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from the ſame Condition. Some time after, coming to my ſelf, I found the Stranger Recovered, from whom I received the Aſſiſtance I had before given him; and being invited to a Houſe, he told me he had not many Furlongs from thence, I accepted of his kindneſs; and as we walked ſoftly on together, gave him ſo fair an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Life, as to let him know, the Picture I found hanging on his Breaſt was more diſturbing to me than what I had ſuffered by being Caſt away at Sea; to which he was about to give me an Anſwer, when we were met by ſeveral of his Servants, who expreſt a great Surprize to find him Bloody and on Foot; whereupon he told them a Company of Villains had aſſaulted him at unawares, and killing his Horſe under him, he ſaved his Life, by falling from a Precipice muſt in all probability have ended it. We went ſoftly after meeting them, to his Country-Lodg; and as ſoon as we came in ſight of it, another ſervant meeting him delivered him a Letter, which after he had read, ſeeming pleaſed, he delivered it to me to peruſe, which as near as I can remember was to this effect:

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56696:79"/>
would acquaint me how the Picture came into his Poſſeſſion, and by what means he learnt all the Circumſtances both of <hi>Narciſſa</hi>'s and <hi>Alvaro</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, but intreated me firſt to ſatisfy his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in hearing what had paſt with me ſince I left <hi>Alicant;</hi> which I not only did, but recited to him moſt of thoſe Paſſages of my Life, which your Highneſs has had the trouble of hearing; and in Requital, received from him this following Relation.</p>
               <p>As near as I can conjecture, <hi>Felicius</hi> (ſaid he) by what you have repeated of the Adventure in <hi>Fernando</hi>'s houſe, <hi>Narciſſa</hi> eſcaped thorow the door you had juſt removed from, to Execute that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice on <hi>Leriano</hi> was due to his Inſolence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce awake, clapt it after her, which lock'd you in, leaving the Key on the other ſide with which <hi>Leriano</hi> muſt have opened it, whereby yours became uſeleſs; but by that time ſhe got into the Garden hearing a noiſe thorow all the houſe, and believing you muſt of neceſſity fall under her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Rage, with what Paſſion, Sighs and Tears did ſhe lament the danger you was expoſed to! and knowing her own would not be leſs after your diſcovery in the houſe, ſhe ran to the Garden door, and got out in ſight of <hi>Grotillus</hi> and his Man, who were Witneſſes of the haſt ſhe made from a place of ſo many threatning Hazards. She took ſtrait down the firſt Street, being in a Night dreſs and without a Veil; deſigning if poſſible, to find your Houſe, which ſhe was as ignorant of, as unacquainted with the Streets of <hi>Alicant,</hi> but though ſhe ſoon went a contrary way to that ſhe intended, her fortune was ſuch that upon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56696:80"/>
into a narrow Street, a Man took notice of her Garb, and believing her a Woman in diſtreſs, made a generous offer of his Aſſiſtance to ſecure her; which ſhe accepted of, deſiring he would be her Guide to your houſe; the mention of which place, making him take more particular notice of her, not without the greateſt amazement imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, he knew her to be <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> and diſcovering himſelf to be <hi>Alvaro,</hi> learn'd abruptly from her ſome part of the nights Diſaſter; ſo that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the imminence of the danger, he conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to his own houſe, and having ſecured her in a Chamber unſeen by any body, he went to look you out, firſt at your own houſe, but finding all quiet there, and that your ſervants knew nothing where you was, he went on to <hi>Fernando</hi>'s, where all being in an uproar, and the Neighbours come in upon the noiſe of <hi>Leriano</hi>'s Death, crowding among the Company, untaken notice of, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a general Account of what had paſſed, and found you to be the perſon pitched upon for the Murderer; ſo that conſidering the danger <hi>Narciſſa</hi> was in, while at his Houſe, which he ſuppoſed would be one of the firſt ſearched for you, he being lookt on by the whole City as your moſt intimate Friend, haſting home as faſt as he could, without making any Diſturbance, he got a Horſe Sadled, and taking <hi>Narciſſa</hi> behind him, rode away directly to <hi>Peniaflor;</hi> but coming thither, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to raiſe any Body that might admit him into the Houſe, and fearing any ſtay near <hi>Alicant,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined at once to put her in a place of ſafety, which he thought <hi>Policena</hi>'s Houſe would be; from whence he determined either to acquaint you with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56696:80"/>
the place he had retreated to, or return privately <hi>to Alicant</hi> in your ſearch; ſo Riding out of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage again, by day-light he had left it ſome Leagues behind him, but fearing the High-Road too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he quitted it, and adventured to find the way thorow the great Foreſt; and at laſt having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf, and taken up for ſeveral nights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome Herds-men, whoſe habitations were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly little Huts, he reach'd <hi>Vanaroz</hi> a ſmall Town on the Coaſt about tenn Leagues from <hi>Valentia,</hi> whence a Boat being, ſoon after his Arrival, ready to go off, his Horſe quite tired out, and thinking the eaſineſs of the Paſſage would be a refreſhing to <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> they both embarqued on it about Sun-ſet, with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Patron that they ſhould Land next day before Noon at <hi>Valencia;</hi> But the dawn of the Morning ſcarce appeared, when they were board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Turks Pinnace, and unable to reſiſt, were carried to their Ship which plyed farther off at Sea, having ſent their Boat cloſe into Shore for ſuch Prize as they could Light on. It would be needleſs to repeat the afflictions of <hi>Narciſſa</hi> and your Friend; therefore let it ſuffice that I tell you, the ſame day ſeveral Gallies coming in ſight, Chaſed the Ship they were in, and by the help of their Oars, there being little Wind, gained ſo faſt upon it, that the diſconſolate Captives, perceiving by their Colours they belonged to <hi>Spain,</hi> conceived joyful hopes of deliverance, which after a ſmall reſiſtance of the <hi>Turks</hi> was accompliſhed. <hi>Alvaro</hi> preſently removed his fair Charge on Board the <hi>Admiral-Gally</hi> where he met his antient Friend <hi>Alvaro Felix,</hi> who had embarqued with his Wife from <hi>Denia,</hi> and I gueſs occaſioned your miſtake in believing him the other
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56696:81"/>
                  <hi>Alvaro,</hi> at that time <hi>Felix</hi> deſign'd his Voyage for <hi>Valentia,</hi> but afterwards upon ſome advice he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved altered it to <hi>Sevill.</hi> I cannot omit one Paſſage which was by the two friends obſerved with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that <hi>Narciſſa</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> were both in Shape and Feature ſo alike, that it was not over eaſie to diſtinguiſh one from the other. But to proceed, I will only tell you that they Landed at the firſt Port the Gallies touched at, unwilling to be expoſed lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at Sea; from whence <hi>Alvaro</hi> having writ to you, to the Counteſs <hi>Policenas,</hi> an Account of what I have now related, he proceeded in Company of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> and the two Ladies to end their Journey by Land.</p>
               <p>But now for a while, to make all more plain to you, I muſt digreſs from their Story, to acquaint you with ſome Accidents relating to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enriquez</hi> in this part of his Diſcourſe ſtopt a little, keeping me ſtrangely ſuſpended with the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination how ſo many particulars of my concerns ſhould come to his Knowledge, till perceiving my impatience, and having told him nothing could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me more than the Recital of his own Life he ſaid to me.</p>
               <p>My Deſcent is from the Antient Family of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> by Birth a <hi>Sevilian,</hi> and the Order I wear, beſtowed on me when a Child, by my Fathers procurement. Having ſpent ſome time at my Studies, I removed from the Univerſity to the Court; and ſome Months after was by the urgency of buſineſs called home again, where I did not long enjoy that Freedome I had preſerved abroad, ſoon reſigning all my thoughts to the Contemplation of <hi>Niquea</hi>'s Beauty, a young Lady of our City whoſe perfections were not more
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56696:81"/>
Celebrated, than her diſdainful Humour diſagreeable to all thoſe, would gladly have profeſſed themſelves her Servants. At firſt, unwilling to engage my ſelf where I had ſmall hopes of proving ſuccesful, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to baniſh the growing Paſſion from my heart; but finding in a ſhort time it had taken too deep Root to be removed, I gave way to it, and became very aſſiduous in paſſing often by her houſe, and being in thoſe places, I had the leaſt imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeeing her in; which was as ſoon perceived by her, but my Reſpect procured only the advantage of finding her coyneſs increaſed every day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, to that degree, would have quenched a Flame had been leſs violent than mine. At length having by the power of large gifts won her Maid, I prevailed with her to deliver a Letter from me to her Lady, which was with ſo little ſucceſs, that the preſumption, as it was termed, had like to have coſt the loſs of her place. And <hi>Niquea</hi> to free her ſelf from my farther importunity, ſoon after removed to a Country-houſe of her Fathers, ſome miles out of Town: reſolving to wait there his return, from a Journey he had ſome time before undertaken; but I was reſolved however, not to deſiſt from my pretence, ſo that getting entertainment in a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers houſe not far from hers, I ſpent many days in a Grove adjacent. ſeeking in vain for an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſeeing her or ſpeaking with my confident <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vela;</hi> till one Evening I fortuned to ſee her enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Grove with her Maid and an antient Woman in her Company, and after having walked round it, ſhe ſat down near the place I had concealed my ſelf in, leaſt my ſight ſhould have made her return back; when believing I muſt never hope a fitter oppertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56696:82"/>
to tell her my grief, though without much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urance, I roſe up and went towards her, who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me come, ſtarted from the place where ſhe ſat, and returned as faſt as ſhe could to her houſe; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be tranſported with the height of her diſdain, and would have overtaken her to complain of it, had not <hi>Clavela</hi> ſtept to me, and adviſed the contrary, withal telling me when it was dark ſhe would ſpeak with me from one of the ground Windows of the houſe, where ſhe would wait my coming. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being able nor daring to preſs farther, I depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſatisfaction little enough, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome hopes of finding <hi>Clavela</hi> my aſſiſtant. I was punctual to the appointment ſhe made me, but was ſcarce come within ſight of the Houſe, when I was alarmed with a confuſed noiſe of people, crying out, <hi>Fire, Fire! help</hi> Niquea, <hi>or ſhe is loſt! the flames have ſeized her Chamber!</hi> You may imagine I was not ſlow to offer my aſſiſtance, and commanding the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant I had with me to follow, I ran to the door of the houſe which I found open, and upon my firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, an ancient Gentlewoman ran to me, and drowned in tears, begged I would afford my help to <hi>Niquea</hi> and her Maid who were encompaſſed by thoſe flames had already poſſeſt moſt part of the Houſe: I ſcarce had patience to ask which way led to her Chamber, but ſecuring my face from the fire with my Cloak, I ruſhed into the middle of it, and gaining the foot of the Stairs, felt my way up, not daring to remove my covering, which was half burnt as well as my Cloaths before I got quite up, when turning once or twice as the walls guided me, I found my ſelf got beyond the fire, and calling aloud to thoſe had been ſhut up by it; <hi>Clavela</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56696:82"/>
a door came out to me, and following her back into her Ladies Chamber, I found her extended on the floor in a ſwound, through the fright ſhe had been in; but then my apprehenſions grew more violent than ever; to convey her forth by the way I came was impoſſible, the fire ſtill increaſing upon the ſtairs; and other way I could diſcern none, unleſs from the Window which was too high to let her down from; but my careful Servant, though not hardy enough to follow me through the Houſe; being told where abouts her Chamber was, ran to the outſide, and by that time I had taken her up in my arms, he called out and told me I might get back from the Window by a Ladder he had ſet up againſt it; ſo that breaking down the Caſement, I recovered the Yard with my adored charge, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her to the little Houſe had been my Habitation for ſome time: <hi>Clavela</hi> got her into my Bed and I was returned again to my room before ſhe came to her ſelf; which when ſhe did, and was informed what I had done for her preſervation, before I left her for the remainder of that Night, I had ſome hopes, my little ſervice would turn all her former diſdain into ſuch favours as before I began wholly to deſpair of. The next day ſhe removed back to the City, the Houſe after we left it being wholly conſumed by the fire; accepting of my Coach, I had ſent for, to carry her thither with her Aunt, who was the ancient woman I met the Night before, and firſt deſired my aſſiſtance for <hi>Niqueas</hi> preſervation. I returned from the Country with them, and found ſo happy an alteration in my condition, that they both allowed of the daily viſits I made them. Not long after her Father returned from his journey,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56696:83"/>
and being acquainted with what I had done for his Daughters ſafety, treated me with all the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I could wiſh from my Miſtreſſes Father; but what was more delightful to me, was the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence my Love received from one had heretofore been a ſtranger to all paſſions but that of hatred; permitting me to viſit her on all occaſions, whereby we ſoon came to a reſolution of deſiring her Father to permit the conſummation of our wiſhes by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>About this time arrived in our parts <hi>Alvaro</hi> and <hi>Narciſſa, Felix</hi> and his <hi>fair Wife,</hi> who being related to <hi>Niquea,</hi> we both had ſoon notice of their being near us; and continually viſiting one another, I learned from them ſo much of your adventures as I have related to you, and <hi>Felix</hi> acquainting me with his late Travels, told me the paſſage you diſcovered in part, of <hi>Grotillus</hi> and the Coach, which was thus. <q>After <hi>Felix</hi> had ſpoken to <hi>Jacinto</hi> and <hi>Caſſandra</hi> to walk ſoftly after the Coath, it drove on near a League before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of taking them in, when perceiving the Night come on and very dark, he ſtopt till they ſhould overtake him, but ſoon after was ſet upon by a Squadron of Horſemen, ſome preſenting their charged Piſtols at the doors of the Coach, while others bound the Coach man and hamſtringed the Horſes; one of them telling him as he tendred his life not to offer any reſiſtance; to which he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, however valuable life was, he would expoſe his ſingle one in defence of the Lady was in his Company. But whatever he could do, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by number, they forced him and <hi>Iſabella</hi> out of the Coach, ſome diſtance from the Road, where they were met by a young Gentleman, who
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56696:83"/>
finding the miſtake he owned his men had been guilty of, begged their pardon a thouſand times for the rudeneſs they had received from them; endeavouring to excuſe the uſage they had met with, by telling them his name was <hi>Grotillus,</hi> that he was ſuddenly to be married to <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> when you who was before a declared enemy of their Family had ſtole her away, and having armed his ſervants was abroad in purſuit of his Miſtreſs, and her (termed) Raviſher, when one of his men told him, he had ſeen <hi>Narciſſa</hi> in a Coach, with one called <hi>Alvaro</hi> on the Road, which error he found grounded on the likeneſs of two faces; what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements paſſed between them, (continued <hi>Enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi>) you heard your ſelf, what remains to add is, that <hi>Grotillus</hi> accompanying them to a neighbour Village, they ſtayed there that Night, and the next Day he ſupplyed them with Horſes to purſue their journey, which they did to <hi>Denia,</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſome unexpected news, <hi>Felix</hi> returned by Sea to <hi>Sevil,</hi> meeting with <hi>Alvaro</hi> and <hi>Narciſſa</hi> in a Turks prize, as I have before told you. From <hi>Sevil</hi> they wrote you word again to <hi>Valentia</hi> of the place they were in, waiting ſeveral dayes for your anſwer, but receiving none, <hi>Iſabella</hi> only ſtaying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, <hi>Felix Alvaro,</hi> and my ſelf accompanied <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſa</hi> from <hi>Sevil,</hi> the next day I returned back, leaving them to purſue their journey to <hi>Valentia.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Having proceeded thus far, at my requeſt, <hi>Enriquez</hi> continued his own ſtory; telling me, that upon his coming back from bringing <hi>Narciſſa</hi> on her way, he received notice of the <hi>Duke of Medinas</hi> death at <hi>Saint Lucar,</hi> and being related to him, was obliged to be there in order to attend at his Funeral, where being
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56696:84"/>
detained ſome days, he was acquainted by a Letter from his Servant <hi>Menandro,</hi> that <hi>Niquea</hi> was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be married to one <hi>Bernardo,</hi> a Gentleman who had no other commendable quality but that of being very rich; and that not only the Father, but ſhe her ſelf approved very well of the match. This intelligence, (which I could not doubt being well aſſured both of the integrity and judgement of the Writer) made me immediately return back by poſt, and alighting at my own door without going in, hearing <hi>Menandro</hi> was abroad, I went directly to the ſtreet where <hi>Niquea's</hi> Father lived; and full of horror found it crowded with Coaches had brought Viſitants, as I was told, to <hi>Alonſo's</hi> Houſe, to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his concluſion of a Match between his Daughter and <hi>Bernardo,</hi> which was to be effected the next day. Tranſported with this advice, hiding my face with my Cloak, I went into the Houſe and up into a large Room, where at a diſtance from the crowd I ſaw <hi>Niquea</hi> very richly dreſt, ſitting with all appearance of mirth among her Relations, and ſoon after ſaw <hi>Bernardo</hi> brought in, as in triumph by his; I was at firſt about to ſtab him in the midſt of them, overwhelmed with my choler, but believing the chaſtiſement of her falſhood would be greater to be ſacrificed to ſuch an inconſiderable wretch; I retired back to my own Houſe, and the ſame Night took Horſe without any Company, ordering my Servants to follow me to this place, with a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of never more returning to <hi>Sevil:</hi> but before my departure I writ a Letter to <hi>Niquea,</hi> upbraiding her ingratitude and falſhood. I have now been here three days, and a while before we met, having rode out to divert my thoughts in the fields, I ſaw a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56696:84"/>
of Peaſants, as they appeared by their dreſs, coming towards me; at firſt I took little notice of them, though they were all maſqued, but as ſoon as they came within diſtance, they made a volley of Shot at me; one of which wounding my Horſe, he ſprung from the way and ſtumbling upon a ſmall hillock, came down with me, and getting up before I could free my Feet from the Stirrups, drew me after him to the brow of the Hill, whence being in a maze, I fell, rolling to the bottom, and came to your Feet before I ſtopt.</p>
               <p>What ſatisfaction I received by <hi>Niqueas</hi> Letter you have already perceived. I will conclude with informing you what I have ſince learnt from <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro;</hi> A letter was ſent to <hi>Saint Lucar</hi> after that he wrote, which had eaſed me of all the trouble I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards felt, if it had come to my hands, but my ill fortune brought me away before it came thither.</p>
               <p>And now I muſt let you know, that before my going to <hi>Saint Lucar, Bernardo</hi> had declared himſelf a Servant to <hi>Niquea,</hi> but was ſo ſlighted by her, and ſo little taken notice of by me, looking on him to differ nothing from a Natural, that he publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſted his pretences; and one day after I was gone, being in company where Some in deriſion to him, asked if his Miſtreſs was as diſdainful as ever? he had the inſolence to tell them, he had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of as great favours from her as the moſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Lover could hope from an obliging Miſtreſs, of which, if need were, he could produce teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies under her own hand; the impudence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he reported it, made ſome believe it was not altogether falſe, and his declaration being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Alonſo,</hi> who was moſt deſirous of chaſtiſing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56696:85"/>
his inſolence, but had ſo much wiſdom not to fall to extremities, leſt it might leave a blemiſh on his Daughters reputation; with intent to have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as publick as the ſlander, he ſent for <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> and required him to receed from what he had ſaid, and ſalve his Daughters credit by Marriage; both which he joyfully offered, and made good the firſt, by owning in all company that what he had ſaid of her was out of envy, that another ſhould be more ſucceſsful than himſelf, which he thought me; and <hi>Alonſo,</hi> to clear all miſapprehenſions urged his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conform with his deſires of conſummating the Wedding, which ſhe not only ſeemed willing to do, having other deſigns of her own, but haſtned the effecting of it; which was reſolved on the day after I retired hither from <hi>Sevil;</hi> and accordingly ſhe went to the Church in a Bridal dreſs, accompanied by all her Friends and Relations, whether he ſoon came with the like ceremony, but when all was ready to be conſummated before the Principal of the whole City, ſhe required he ſhould again repeat what he had before owned, that the report of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received Favours from her, was a ſlander, which he repented of and begged her pardon for it; the joyful Lover willingly complied with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and as ſoon as he had done, ſhe told him, no inducement ſhould ever perſwade her to be his Wife, had uſed ſuch diſhonourable means to gain her; and immediately turning about, thanked him for ſo publick a diſcovery of his baſeneſs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by her Friends, went directly out of the Church; and he as ſorrowfully home, after ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a ſlight as ſhe had put upon him, which gained her the general applauſe of the whole City.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56696:85"/>
                  <hi>Manandro</hi> coming home after I was gone, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had been in Town, and was departed again with much diſquiet, ſuſpected his Letter to <hi>Saint Lucar</hi> had been the occaſion of it, and having after he had writ, been informed by <hi>Clavela</hi> of her Ladys deſign, he found an opportunity of ſpeaking with her that Evening, and letting her know of my haſty arrival and retreat out of Town, which both they and <hi>Niquea,</hi> when told of it, concluded to be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by my not receiving her Letters; ſhe obliged him not to follow me till the next day, when having compleated her deſign, ſhe ſent me that Letter I have read to you; and the Peaſants who aſſaulted me, I am apt to think, were <hi>Bernardo</hi> and ſome of his Friends diſguiſed, by whom I might have been diſcovered when I was in <hi>Alonſo's</hi> Houſe, and they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the cauſe of her ſeverity to my ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing there, made them by ſo diſhonourable an attempt ſeek to take away my life.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Enriquez</hi> concluded his relation to me of the adventures he had met with in his Love. And alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impatient of viſiting and reconciling himſelf to his Miſtreſs, for the unjuſt ſuſpition he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of her falſhood, deſired I would excuſe his immediate departure to <hi>Sevil,</hi> whither I prevailed with him to let me bear him company, intending from thence without delay to return back to <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> where I was once more confident of finding <hi>Narciſſa</hi> and my faithful Friend; but the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration I had of appearing before him till I could learn ſome news of his Dear <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve by the way to ſpend ſome time in all the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the <hi>Andaluſian</hi> Coaſt to inquire after her; I had begun my journey the ſame Afternoon we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

In our way paſſing by <hi>Saint Auſtins</hi> Covent, <hi>Enriquez</hi> knew a Coach that ſtood there to be <hi>Niqueas,</hi> and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her in the Church, haſtned his pace thither; but as I followed him with more leiſure, I heard one call me by my name, and turning about ſaw a man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards me with his drawn Sword, who ſcarce giving me time to get my own in the ſame poſture, fell upon me with a violent precipitation; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving luckily put by his firſt paſſes, I cut at his head, which lay open to me, with ſo much force, that meeting with the Hilt of his Sword which he haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held up to ward the blow, mine flew to pieces in my hand, but he was then ſo far from deſiſting from the combate, that my life was in eminent danger, when a Young man who was juſt come out of the Church, placed himſelf by my ſide, in a poſture to defend me; at the ſame time two Gentlemen more newly alighted from a Coach, running in to part us; my adverſary being aſhamed of the advantage he had made uſe of againſt me by the breaking of my Sword, would have retired without being known, having till then his Face covered with his Hat pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down to his Eyes, and a part of his Cloak he held before it; but turning about and treading on it, which hung down to the ground, he ſtumbled and his Hat fell off, when I immediately knew him to be my mortal enemy <hi>Grotillus;</hi> it was then in vain for either of us to purſue our quarrel, and on the contrary I went towards him, and told him, I

ſhould never ſeek after, or wiſh any thing more, than his Friendſhip; at firſt his Choler would not ſuffer him to give me an Anſwer, and in the mean time about to ſpeak to thoſe had afforded me their Aſſiſtance, how joyfully was I ſurprized to find my ſelf in the Arms of my dear <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> and a little way from me, <hi>Alvaro</hi> with <hi>Caſſandra</hi> by the hand, who was the Youth firſt came in to ſecond me in the quarrel; while we were in this Poſture, <hi>Enriquez</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard a noiſe, and miſſing <hi>Niquea</hi> in the Church, came out to us; and being informed of all that had paſt, he went to <hi>Grotillus,</hi> endeavouring to perſwade him to the acceptance of that friendſhip I had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the ſight of his Miſtriſs ſo far aggravated his diſguſt, that no Arguments could be uſed had any prevalence with him; till <hi>Alvaro</hi> giving a ſhort truce to the Joy he had in <hi>Caſſandra</hi>'s being found; went to him, and as I remember, gave both him and the reſt of us, an Account of the Alteration of our Condition in theſe words.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Grotillus</hi> you are Noble and Generous, and will I am confident forget your hatred, when you have heard what I ſhall now tell you; I went from this place towards <hi>Valencia</hi> with <hi>Narciſſa</hi> deſigning to depoſite her in the Houſe of the Counteſs <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena,</hi> till we could Learn ſome News of <hi>Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ms;</hi> and began my Journey from hence with her ſome days ſince, but after two that we had Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, finding her by a ſudden indiſpoſition unfit to go farther; we ſtopt at a Village twenty Leagues off, whether the ſame <hi>Evening</hi> a Stranger coming in to Lodge, and hearing he came from <hi>Valencia,</hi> I went to him to inquire out of Curioſity what News from thoſe parts, who preſently knew me,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56696:87"/>
as I did him, to be <hi>Liſardo</hi> my Friends Servant; he inquired of me whether I knew where <hi>Felicius</hi> was? and having told him I was ignorant, but that <hi>Narciſſa</hi> was in the houſe with me, he deſired to wait on her, and coming into the Room told us that <hi>Felicius</hi> was now an <hi>Earle</hi> by the death of <hi>Policena,</hi> who had declared him her Heir; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that during her ſickneſs hearing <hi>Narciſſa</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in Town, come thither in her ſearch, ſhe ſent for him, and at laſt prevailed ſo far, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf reconciled; and the Counteſs dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two days after, He aſſiſted as chief Mourner at her Obſequies in behalf of <hi>Felicius</hi> whom he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Son; and the Ceremony being over, had ſent him in ſearch of thoſe had been ſo long miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and under his diſpleaſure; the Letters he brought delivering to <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> ſhe opened, (which are here to juſtifie the Truth of what I tell you.) Upon this Information, we returned to <hi>Sevill,</hi> with purpoſe to ſtay there till <hi>Fernando</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted where his daughter was; and having ſo luckily met; it muſt be hoped by all, <hi>Grotillus</hi> will not alone continue that Enmity is removed from the Breaſts of all others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe words of <hi>Alvaro</hi>'s which were as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing to me as to <hi>Grotillus,</hi> he took <hi>Narciſſa</hi> by the hand and delivered her to me with all wiſhes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> I need only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Highneſs the Ship ſhe was on Board ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving ſafe at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> ſhe came the ſame day to <hi>Sevill,</hi> and before entring into any houſe, met me at St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> engaged with <hi>Grotillus,</hi> one paſſage
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56696:87"/>
I muſt not omit, which was the Letter at firſt brought me to <hi>Valencia; Liſardo</hi> my Servant finding the grief I was in, by my ignorance of what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Narciſſa,</hi> forged the Letter to give me a preſent ſatisfaction, and withal to haſten my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Alicant,</hi> where he knew me in the midſt of many Enemies, and afterwards hearing nothing of me, he went to <hi>Valencia,</hi> ſuppoſing it a place where he ſhould ſooneſt learn what was become of me.</p>
               <p>I have nothing more now to trouble your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the hearing of, but to add, that at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of <hi>Enriquez, Narciſſa</hi> and <hi>Caſſandra</hi> ſtayed with his Miſtriſs, and <hi>Alvaro, Grotillus</hi> and my ſelf at his Houſe till the Celebration of his Marriage; in the mean while, ſending to <hi>Fernando</hi> to let him know where we were; and that Ceremony over, <hi>Grotillus</hi> undertook the Conduct of us all hither; where <hi>Alvaro</hi>'s Marriage with <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> and mine with <hi>Narciſſa</hi> were publickly Conſumated a few days before the Arrival of your Highneſs in theſe Parts.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs was ſo well pleaſed with the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Felicius</hi>'s Adventures, that in congratulating their happy Union after ſo much trouble, ſhe could not be diſſatisfied with the imagination, Her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would ſoon in all appearance be as well ſetled as that of thoſe fortunate Lovers ſhe was a Gueſs to; but the fair young Counteſs finding her Lord had made an end of his Relation, deſired he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Dutcheſs and ſatisfy her ſelf, in one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance he had omitted, which ſhe was concerned in; how <hi>Enriquez</hi> came by that Picture of hers he had mentioned? which <hi>Felicius</hi> excuſing his forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of, did by telling them, it was not <hi>Narciſſa</hi>'s
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56696:88"/>
but a Picture of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> he accidentally found in a rich Cabinet <hi>Felix</hi> had preſented to him, and wore it that day to give a diverſion to his thoughts from remembring any more his then ſuppoſed falſe <hi>Niquea;</hi> and afterwards meeting with <hi>Felix</hi> had reſtored it to him.</p>
               <p>At another time the Princeſs would have found as much ſatisfaction among ſuch obliging Company as ſhe could have wiſhed; But the impatience ſhe was in for the Ships return had ſailed in ſearch of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and to ſee <hi>Mantua</hi> again, gave a great check to her preſent tranquility. But a few days after her trouble was removed by the Arrival not only of that but ſeveral other of her own Ships; and the perſon ſhe had ſent out coming aſhore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her that meeting thoſe Frigats were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, he made the beſt of his way back, having ſent a light Veſſel to <hi>Majorca</hi> to acquaint the <hi>King of Sicily</hi> where the Dutcheſs was, who ſailed thither with a Reſolution of laying waſt the whole Iſland, if that Prince did not deliver her back to him; ſhe being generally believed there in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>By that time the Dutcheſs had received this ſhort Account of his Voyage, all the Principal Officers of the little Fleet were landed, and come to pay their Duty to their Princeſs, and congratulate her ſafe delivery from the hands of a violent Raviſher; whom ſhe received with her accuſtomed goodneſs; and having told <hi>Felicius</hi> as much before, acquainted them with her reſolution of Sailing the next day for <hi>Mantua,</hi> commanding to have all things ready for her departure againſt that time; But if the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan Princeſs</hi> was pleaſed with the ſuddenneſs of her
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56696:88"/>
departure towards <hi>Italy</hi> after ſo long an abſence, the generous <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had enjoyed ſo much of her Company, could not but expreſs themſelves trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the thoughts of looſing it, and had ſhe not abſolutely refuſed their deſire; <hi>Felicius</hi> and his Lady would have waited on her to <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning having notice that all things were provided, and the Wind fair; with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral trouble, ſhe took leave of her obliging Friends, having preſented <hi>Narciſſa</hi> with ſeveral rich Jewels, and accepted of a promiſe they made to viſit Her in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fortune now weary of perſecuting Her, after tenn days being at Sea, the Fleet came in ſight of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> diſcerning a greater at the ſame time making in for the Road, which they conjectured right to be the <hi>Sicilian Kings,</hi> and by that time the Dutcheſſes Ship was come to an Anchor, they diſcovered the Royal Standard of that King, diſplaid on the Topmaſt head of his Admiral-Frigat.
